== Intro

When a transaction is sent to a node, it is first included in the xref:{url_network_txpool}[transaction pool].
Transactions in the transaction pool wait to be included in a block on the blockchain.

It may be the case, that the transaction sender intends to update the transaction before it is included in a block.
For example, to update specific parameters of the transaction, to replace the transaction entirely, or to speed up the inclusion of the transaction into a block by providing a higher fee.

This can be achieved by resending the updated transaction with a higher fee while using the same nonce, as explained in the following steps.

.This only works for transactions in the transaction pool
IMPORTANT: Overwriting a transaction is only possible for transactions, which haven't been included in a block, yet.

When the updated transaction is accepted by the node, it will be added to the transaction pool.
If the transaction pool already contains the original transaction with the same nonce with the same sender account, validators can choose which transaction to include into the next block.
Generally, a validator will always choose to include the transactions with the highest transaction fees, to maximize their rewards for generating new blocks.
That is why, if two transactions from the same sender with the same nonce exist in the pool, the transaction with the higher fee will be picked preferably to be included into a block.

As soon as the updated transaction is included in a block, it will invalidate the remaining original transaction, because of the outdated nonce.
As a result, the transaction will be removed from the transaction pool.

== Example: Original transaction

Let's assume we have sent the following transaction to the node, but it is currently pending in the transaction pool, because of too many other transactions waiting in the pool with higher fees:

}

To speed up the inclusion of our transaction into the blockchain, we intend to recreate the exact same transaction with a higher fee.

== Recreating the transaction

Create a new transaction with the same nonce and a higher fee.

A slightly higher fee than specified in the original transaction suffices so that validators will prefer to include the new transaction instead of the old with a lower fee.

NOTE: In case the network is currently very busy, it can be useful to adjust the fee even higher, so it is included faster into a block than the other transactions in the transaction pool.

TIP: Make sure to use the `--nonce` flag to specify the same nonce as in the transaction you wish to overwrite.

[source,bash]

Finally, send the new transaction to the node to overwrite the original transaction:
