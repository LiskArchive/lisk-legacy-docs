In the "Understand Lisk blockchain" category you learn the basic concepts of Lisk based blockchain applications, including how they are structured and which topics and terms are important to know when developing within the Lisk ecosystem.

This page gives an overview of what Lisk Blockchain is? what are the key elements of a Lisk blockchain? what are blockchain applications and Lisk protocol? and how information flows through the Lisk Blockchain?

== What is Lisk Blockchain?

A blockchain is a chain of interconnected blocks that exist on various nodes distributed across a P2P network.
Each node keeps their own copy of the blockchain protocol and related data. 
It syncs periodically with other nodes to make sure that the records of the node are up to date.

The Lisk blockchain also follows the same principal.
It is a combination of an interconnected main-chain and many side-chains.
Each side chain is registered to the mainchain and is specific to a blockchain application.
Unlike Ethereum, where dApps have to share the same chain for their blockchain needs, Lisk provides the oppertunity for each application to have their own side chain.

This enables slower growth of a chain as information is only recieved from a single blockchain application.
It also provides faster block generation and lessens the burden on the network.
These side chains can also communicate with other side chains with the help of <<Lisk\'s Cross Chain Communication protocol>>.

Applications built with Lisk blockchains are called "blockchain applications". These applications can have customized logic, UIs  and a blockchain as their application's database.
An overview of what Lisk Blockchain is all about can be seen in the following diagram.

image::understand-blockchain/lisk-blockchain-overview.png["Lisk blockchain overview", 600, align="center"]

xref:{url_lisk_service}[Lisk Service] is a platform that allows interaction with various blockchain networks based on Lisk protocols.
Whilst building a blockchain application with a customized UI, it is recommended to use the off the shelf Lisk Service that provides an interface to communicate with the blockchain network.






== What are blockchain applications?

A blockchain application is any kind of application which uses its' own blockchain as a database layer.

More specifically, within the Lisk documentation, every time we talk about blockchain applications, we are referring to applications running on blockchains that are compatible with xref:{url_protocol}[].

Blockchain applications are highly customizeable as the Lisk protocol allows, creation of a scalable UI and business logic on top of Lisk Service. 

.Examples of blockchain applications
****
Examples of blockchain applications can be found in the tutorials, such as the xref:{url_tutorials_nft}[], or the xref:{url_tutorials_srs}[] application.

Additionally, check out the apps list at {url_lisk_apps}[^]

=== Lisk Network

A blockchain application generally consists of a network of servers, which are also called *nodes* in this context.

A typical network of nodes is illustrated in the diagram below:

image:intro/node-network.png[Side chain's node network, 900 ,align="center"]

.Shared on-chain logic, optional off-chain logic
****
All nodes in the network need to share the same <<on-chain-logic>> (Modules), while the <<off-chain-logic>> (Plugins) of the application may differ from node to node.
****

==== P2P: Unstructured partial mesh network
The P2P network of nodes is unstructured, which means that all nodes are equal participants in the network.

It is also a partial mesh network, which means that every node is only connected to a small subset of nodes in the network.

Unstructured partial mesh networks allow nodes to share information in the network in a very expeditious and secure manner with all other nodes.
They also possess the ability to scale extremely well, even for large networks with thousands of connected nodes.


=== Architecture of Lisk Protocol



A block application consists of Lisk protocol that is replicated to a P2P network of nodes.
Collectively, a set of nodes form a side-chain, which is registered to the main-chain.
Nodes can only connect to either the main-chain or the side-chain.

Each blockchain applications has their own side-chain and with-in a side-chain there is a network of P2P nodes.
Each node has a copy of the protocol which they use to fulfill the needs of the blockchain application.

The Lisk Blockchain Protocol is divided into two layers:

* Application layer
* Engine layer

image:architecture.png[lisk-framework-architecture, 900 , align="center"]


==== Application layer
The application layer is responsible for state changes to the blockchain.
It's jobs is to connect with the outside world i.e. external services, softwares and send and recieve data from them.
An application layer consists of a state machine, modules, plugins, and configuration.

===== State machine

As the name suggests, a state machine is relevant to states of a machine, Lisk protocol relies heavily on its state machine to mutate state of a blockchain. 

* *States:* A state machine typically has a set of different states that it can enter. For example, a padlock represented as state machine would have the two states "Open" and "Locked".

* *Transitions*: a set of allowable operations that change from one state to another. For example, to change from state "Open" to "Locked", a transition would be "Close padlock", and from "Locked" to "Open", it would be "Insert key & turn".
Each instance of a Lisk is replicated to a node.

It does that with the help of modules, which define the on-chain logic for the blockchain application.

===== Modules

Modules aid the state machine to transition state of the blockchain with verified and validated data.
They contain on-chain logic which is part of the blockchain protocol.

For example, if Bob wants to sends 10 LSKs to Alice then, behind the scenes a module will verify the validity of such a request.
Upon validation and verification, the module will ask the state machine to transfer 10 LSKs from Bob's account to Alice's account.

TIP: Lisk provides a range of modules out of the box, for more information see <<LINK>>


====== When to create a module

xref:{url_introduction_modules}[Modules] are able to perform the following functions:

* Define how data is stored on the blockchain.
* Define logic which is executed per block footnote:block_footnote[].
* Define logic which is executed per transaction footnote:tx_footnote[].


===== Plugins

Plugins represent the off-chain logic.
Plugins are not part of the Lisk protocol so, different plugins can be part of different nodes as shown in the network diagram.
Plugins are not directly part of the Lisk protocol and they can be added to the application layer as per necessity.


For example, consider a case where a node wants to investigate possible misbehaviours in the Lisk network. For that, node operator must gather all the blocks' data from the network, store it somewhere and analyse it to catch a misbehviour.

While this can be done from scratch, Lisk provides the xref:{url_references_report_misbbehavior_plugin}[Report Misbehavior Plugin] that listens to blocks data and automatically reports a node about a delegate's misbehaviour.

TIP: Lisk provides a set of plugins that can be injected into the Application layer when needed, see xref:{url_sdk_plugins}[Plugins].


====== When to create a plugin

xref:{url_introduction_plugins}[] are able to perform the following:

* Search the blockchain data.
* Aggregate the blockchain data.
* Provide a UI for the blockchain application.
* Automate the blockchain logic, such as automatically sending transactions.
* Add a proxy to the application interfaces.


A blockchain application does not include any plugins by default, however, to extend and customize the application, register the desired plugins to the application.

To add a new plugin to your application, either reuse an already existing plugin from another blockchain application, or create a new plugin based on the specific requirements of your application.

=== Blockchain applications vs. dApps
As blockchain applications are also in a sense decentralized applications, you may wonder what is the difference between blockchain applications and dApps, or if there is any difference at all.

In short, the main difference between dApps and blockchain applications is that blockchain applications each run on their own blockchain/sidechain, while dApps are sharing the blockchain network with other dApps.

dApps are generally constructed as smart contracts, for example on the Ethereum blockchain.
The development of blockchain applications is quite different, because it is much more similar to building a normal web application.

Most functionalities of smart contracts can be implemented in blockchain applications much easier and in a more straight forward manner.
However, there is one important difference here to dApps, when it comes to applying new <<on-chain-logic>> to the application:
New smart contracts can be directly applied on the running blockchain, while adding new on-chain logic to blockchain applications always requires a hard fork in the network.
Therefore, blockchain applications are less flexible than dApps, when it comes to uploading new logic on the running chain.

If the flexible characteristics of smart contracts are desired inside a blockchain application, it is of course also possible to develop a blockchain application which supports smart contracts.
For example, a new module could be added to the application, which accepts smart contracts.
This way it is possible to have the best of both worlds combined.

Additionally, smart contracts can reuse an already existing blockchain, which saves time when launching the application, as it is not necessary to take care of setting up an independent blockchain network, finding delegates footnote:delegate_footnote[For more information about delegates, check the xref:{url_protocol_consensus}[Consensus algorithm] page of the Lisk protocol.], etc.

Blockchain applications on the contrary rely on their own blockchain, and therefore also need to take care of maintaining their own network.
In the beginning, this will make the launch of the application slightly more complex, however, having an independent network comes with numerous benefits which are covered in the following paragraphs.

The Lisk documentation is referring to applications built with the Lisk SDK as "blockchain applications" and not "dApps". In order to clarify the difference here, applications are not sharing a common blockchain, but instead are each running on their own chain.
As a result blockchain applications have the following advantages:

* Lower transaction fees, as high traffic of one blockchain application has no effect on other blockchain applications.
* The blockchain for the application can be designed with the optimal characteristics for the specific use case, (for example by adjusting the block time or the number of delegates, or even changing the whole consensus algorithm).
* A much more scalable blockchain, as it only handles the data from one blockchain application.
Therefore it is growing much slower in size, and doesn't suffer so much from potential bottlenecks in the network, which can happen during times of high workload on many different dApps.
* Interoperability: Register a blockchain application as a sidechain to connect it to the Lisk Mainchain, (this is coming {url_lisk_roadmap}[soon^]).
This will provide seamless interoperability to the Lisk Mainchain and all of its' connected sidechains.

All important components of a blockchain application are displayed in the diagram below:

=== Communication interfaces / APIs

image::intro/communication-architecture.png[,1000 ,align="center"]

The communication architecture of the Lisk SDK allows internal application components and external services to communicate to the blockchain application via various channels.

The Lisk SDK provides two industry standard communication protocols: Inter Process Communication (IPC) and Web Sockets (WS).
The communication protocol of the blockchain application is changed in the xref:{url_advanced_architecture_config}[configuration].

It is possible to communicate to modules and plugins directly by invoking xref:{url_advanced_communication_actions}[actions] via a RPC request, or by subscribing to xref:{url_advanced_communication_events}[events].

It is recommended to use the IPC/WebSocket protocols where possible, as they provide a more enhanced performance in regard to the response times, (see the blog post: {url_blog_benchmark}[Benchmarking Lisk Core v3.0.0 against Lisk Core v2.1.6]).
// However, if you prefer an HTTP API, it is possible to add support for custom APIs by registering additional plugins, such as the xref:{url_references_http_plugin}[].
//We also recommend to try out xref:{url_service}[Lisk Service], which provides a much more comprehensive API compared to the HTTP API plugin.

For more information about the communication architecture, check out the xref:{url_advanced_communication}[endpoints explanation].

=== Frontend & backend

Blockchain applications usually consist of a frontend and a backend part, just as normal web applications.

In contrast to normal server-client applications, there is not one central backend, but rather a whole network of nodes which together secure and maintain the status of the blockchain.
Each node can handle complex business logic and provides a flexible and customizable API.
The blockchain itself is used as a database layer for the application.

The frontend allows users to interact conveniently with the blockchain application.
The implementation of a frontend is totally flexible.
For example, this can be achieved in the following ways:

[loweralpha]
. Create a new xref:{url_introduction_plugins}[plugin] for the blockchain application.
An example implementation of a frontend as a plugin is the {url_github_lns_dashboard}[LNS UI plugin] for the example application *Lisk Name Service*.
. Use your favorite framework/ programming language to develop a user interface, and communicate to the node via the <<communication-interfaces-apis>>.
One example is the frontend of the {url_github_srs}[SRS example application^] , which has been developed with React.js.
Another example is the UI for the Hello World application, detailed in the guide xref:{url_integrate_ui}[].
. For later requirements in a production environment, a middleware similar to Lisk Service should be used, which will aggregate the data from the blockchain network and possibly other 3rd party sources as well.
The frontend can then request this data via API requests from the middleware.
