= Calculating the minimum fee for a transaction

For every transaction it is possible to calculate the minimum fee required by using the short formula listed below:

 minFee = transactionBytes.length * minFeePerByte + baseFee

It is directly connected to the size of the transaction object in bytes after it has been encoded, and also to the optional `baseFee` of a transaction.

Fortunately, the `apiClient` is capable of performing all the necessary steps of the calculation:

 client.transaction.computeMinFee(signedTxWithSomeFee);

All that is required to calculate the fee of a transaction is the transaction itself, which is passed as a parameter to the `computeMinFee()` function of the API client.

== Connect the API client to a node

First, create a function `getClient()`, which will return an instance of the API client.

The API client connects to a local node, having the RPC API enabled via WebSockets at port `8080`.

If you wish to connect to a different node, simply update the API URL defined in `nodeAPIURL`.

.index.js
[source,js]
----
const { apiClient, transactions } = require('@liskhq/lisk-client');

let clientCache;
const nodeAPIURL = 'ws://localhost:8080/ws'

const getClient = async () => {
	if (!clientCache) {
		clientCache = await apiClient.createWSClient(nodeAPIURL);
	}
	return clientCache;
};
----

== Calculate minimumFee

A new transaction can be created with the API client in a convenient manner, assuming that the respective transaction asset type is known to the respective blockchain application.
Generally, a blockchain application is only aware of the assets that are part of modules registered to the application.

In this example, connect to the xref:{url_hello_world}[Hello World blockchain application], so we can use the Hello transaction asset.
The Hello asset is part of the Hello module which is registered to the 'Hello World' application.

To calculate the minimum fee of a transaction, first create the respective transaction and sign it.

A value for the transaction fee is already required to create and sign the transaction.

Therefore, just use an arbitrary default value.
In this example below, we have used 1 LSK.
This value will be replaced with the calculated minimum fee for the transaction in the next step.

.index.js
[source,js]
----
const { apiClient, transactions } = require('@liskhq/lisk-client');

// ...

const calcMinFee = async (client) => {
	const signedTxWithSomeFee = await client.transaction.create({
		moduleID: 1000,
		assetID: 0,
		fee: BigInt(transactions.convertLSKToBeddows("1")),
		asset: {
			helloString: "Hello World!"
		}
	}, passphrase);

	return client.transaction.computeMinFee(signedTxWithSomeFee);
}
----

== Post the transaction with minimumFee

In the next function, the minimum fee is directly used as the fee for the transaction that is sent to the node.

For the final step, all the above defined functions are called and the calculated minimum fee and the node API response are logged in the terminal.

.index.js
[source,js]
----
const { apiClient, transactions } = require('@liskhq/lisk-client');

// ...

const postTx = async (client, minFee) => {
	const signedTx = await client.transaction.create({
		moduleID: 1000,
		assetID: 0,
		fee: minFee,
		asset: {
			helloString: "Hello World!"
		}
	}, passphrase);

	return client.transaction.send(signedTx).then(res => {
		return res;
	});
}

getClient().then(client => {
	calcMinFee(client).then(minFee => {
		console.log("Minimum fee for the current transaction: ", minFee);
		postTx(client, minFee).then((res) => {
			console.log(res);
			process.exit(0);
		});
	})
})
----

== Execute

If the script is now executed in the terminal, it will display the minimum fee for the created transaction.
In addition, it will try to send the transaction with the minimum fee.

[source,bash]
----
% node index.js
Minimum fee for the current transaction:  127000n
{
  transactionId: '85d90e6ac5c76538ce0b8625adf5c1db40b6209caceabc4e25cb41232cd1fdd1'
}
----

If the transaction was accepted by the node, the respective transaction ID will be logged in the terminal.

[TIP]
====
To verify that this is in fact the minimum fee, try to send a transaction with a slightly smaller transaction fee:

.Reducing the fee by 1 Beddow
 fee: minFee-BigInt("1"),

Then when executing the script again, you should see the following error in the terminal:

 (node:14890) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Error: Insufficient transaction fee. Minimum required fee is: 127000
