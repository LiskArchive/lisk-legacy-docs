====
In this chapter, you'll learn how to:

* [x] Create CCM inside a command
* [x] Execute a CCM inside a cc_command
* [x] Test the implementation of an interoperable module by running the interop example scripts.
====

If a Lisk app intends to interact with other blockchains in the network, it needs to provide the required cross-chain commands that create and execute the corresponding CCMs.

NOTE: To learn more about how sidechains communicate with each other via CCM, check out the page about xref:{url_understand_interopcommunication}[].

To show how interoperable modules are implemented, we will extend the Hello app with a very simple command, allowing other chains to react to Hello messages.

To keep it simple, the example only implements one reaction type: Likes.

The example can be extended to include more reaction types such as likes, dislikes, or replies for Hello messages if desired.

== Creating interoperable modules

If two sidechains intend to interact with each other, for example, if sidechain A wishes to utilize services that sidechain B provides, this can be achieved via *interoperable modules*.

In this context, sidechain A would be the sending chain, and sidechain B would be the receiving chain.

To achieve cross-chain communication, the two sidechains need to fulfill the following requirements:

. *Both* the sending and the receiving chains need to be xref:{url_build_register}[registered as sidechains] to the same mainchain.
. *Both* the sending and the receiving chains need to be *active sidechains*, with at least one xref:{url_run_relayer}[relayer] node connected to the mainchain.
. The *sending chain* needs to implement a module command that *creates* and *sends a CCM*.
. The *receiving chain* needs to implement a module cc_command that *accepts* and *executes the CCM*.

TIP: The {url_github_sdk_interop}[interop example^] contains a complete interoperable set up for you to try out. If you simply want to try it out, refer to the next section <<testing-interoperable-modules>>.

To learn the details about the implementation of the required module commands, check out the following dedicated guides:

* xref:{url_build_createccm}[]
* xref:{url_build_executeccm}[]


== Testing interoperable modules

As the interaction between two sidechains always involves three chains (sending chain, receiving chain, and mainchain), it is quite complicated to test newly implemented interoperable modules locally.

To simplify the process, the `lisk-sdk` provides useful example scripts that can be easily adjusted to try out new interoperable modules.

=== The `interop` example of the `lisk-sdk` repository

[.float-group]

[role="right"]
.The blockchain network of the interop example
image::build-blockchain/interop-example.png[,300,role="right"]

To try out the cross-chain communication of interoperable modules locally, go to the {url_github_sdk_interop}[interop/example^] in the `lisk-sdk` repository.

There, you find a `README.md` which describes all the required steps to set up a simple interoperability example, as illustrated in _Figure 1_.

Additionally, you find examples of how to execute cross-chain token transfers between the chains.

To start the interoperability example, run the {url_github_sdk_interop_startexample}[start_example^] script.

./examples/interop/
[source,bash]
----
./start_example
----

This will install all required dependencies, start all sidechain and mainchain nodes and register them with each other.

Observe the console logs to verify that all steps are executed successfully without errors.
--

==== Verify the sidechain account is funded with mainchain tokens

The account sending the `crossChainReact` command, who will create a new CCM, needs to provide the fees for the execution of the CCM in tokens that are native on the mainchain.
This is why it should be verified, that the account, that intends to send the transaction, owns enough mainchain tokens.

Run the following script to perform a cross chain transfer from the mainchain to sidechain 2:

./examples/interop/
[source,bash]
----
ts-node pos-mainchain-fast/config/scripts/transfer_lsk_sidechain_two.ts
----

NOTE: Wait for a few moments until you check the Balance on sidechain 2, as the cross-chain transfer can take some time

Verify the account intending to send the CCM has enough balance to pay the transaction & CCM fees:

.pos-sidechain-example-two
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run endpoint:invoke token_getBalances '{"address":"lskx5uqu2zzybdwrqswd8c6b5v5aj77yytn4k6mv6"}' --pretty
----

As the response shows, the account has now more than enough sidechain and mainchain tokens to pay the required fees.

[source,json]
----
{
  "balances": [
    {
      "tokenID": "0400000000000000",
      "availableBalance": "910000000000",
      "lockedBalances": []
    },
    {
      "tokenID": "0400000200000000",
      "availableBalance": "100000000000000",
      "lockedBalances": []
    }
  ]
}
----

=== Create a Hello message on sidechain 1

Now, as it is verified, that the sending account has enough tokens to pay the fees for the transaction and the CCM, we can proceed to send a new Hello message on sidechain 1.

Navigate into the folder `pos-sidechain-example-one` and use the node CLI to create a new Hello message.

.pos-sidechain-example-one
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run transaction:create hello createHello 10000000 --json --pretty --key-derivation-path="m/44'/134'/12'" --send
----

You will be prompted for the accounts' passphrase.
Sign the transaction with the passphrase stored in {url_github_sdk_interop_sc1_passphrase}[passphrase.json^] in the `config` folder.

 ? Please enter passphrase:  [hidden]

Next, you will be prompted for a Hello message. This can be any string with a minimum length of 3 and a maximum of 256 characters.

 ? Please enter: message:  Hello sidechain 2! :-)

Because we added the `--json` flag to the command, the transaction is also printed in human-readable JSON format, which allows us to verify all properties of the transaction again.
The `--pretty` flag formats the JSON with proper indents.

  }
}
----

Because we added the `--send` flag to the `transaction:create` command, the transaction is sent to the node directly, after it is created.
The node should respond with the corresponding transaction ID if it accepts the transaction.

 Transaction with id: 'cbd493f4e554c4ffde09a8a0d641164439d5ef9e7605c84d52d2d25248a897a7' received by node.


==== Get the Hello message

To verify that the Hello message was in fact created on the blockchain, use the `hello_getHello` endpoint to get the Hello message for the sending account:

.pos-sidechain-example-one
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run endpoint:invoke hello_getHello '{"address":"lskmjwp8z88avvxn4voktmx8cu9wk4opjkna5owt5"}'
----

If all works correctly, the node should respond with the Hello message that was created in the previous step.

.Response
[source,json]
----
{"message":"Hello sidechain 2! :-)"}
----
=== Create Reaction on sidechain 2

Now that a Hello message exists on sidechain 1, we want to react to this message with an account on sidechain 2.

For this, the user who wishes to react will send a transaction on sidechain 2.

This transaction will create a CCM which is collected by a relayer, and posted to the mainchain.
On the mainchain, it is collected again by a relayer, and posted to the receiving chain, which is sidechain 1 in this case.

To observe the cross-chain communication, please open the Dashboards for sidechain 1 and sidechain 2 in the browser.

Dashboards::
* Sidechain 1: http://localhost:4006[^]
* Sidechain 2: http://localhost:4007[^]

Scroll down on the Dashboards to the "Events" section, and filter for the following events: `CCM Processed`, `CCMSendSuccess`, `CCMSentFailed`

Additionally, it can be beneficial to also observe the logs of the different sidechain nodes.
Open two different terminal windows and display the live node logs inside:

Logs::
* Sidechain 1: `pm2 log 2`
* Sidechain 2: `pm2 log 3`

Now, in a third terminal window, run the following command to create and directly send a reaction to the Hello message on sidechain 1.

We define the following params:

. `reactionType`: The type of the reactions represented as an integer.
We have only implemented type 0 in the example, which represents a like, so we choose `0` here.
. `helloMessageID`: We use the address of the account that created the Hello message to identify the Hello message.
. `receivingChainID`: Chain ID of the receiving chain (= Sidechain 1 in this example).
This property is required to create the CCM.
. `messageFee`: Fee that is paid for the execution of the CCM.
This property is required to create the CCM.
. `messageFeeTokenID`: Token ID of the tokens being used to pay the `messageFee`.
By default, this is the Token ID of the native mainchain Token.
This property is required to create the CCM.

TIP: In the above example, we provide the passphrase directly in the command via the `-p` flag, therefore we are not prompted for the passphrase, and the transaction is signed directly.

}
----

If the node accepts the transaction, it should respond with the corresponding transaction ID.

 Transaction with id: '5043174c97f508b711d9be0ec57ed60009ea83b57b2a665cef8c99420b9fcbb2' received by node.


=== Observe the execution of the CCM

Now go directly to the Dashboard events of *sidechain 2* and look for the following event:

If you see the `ccmSendSuccess` event in the events logs, it means, the CCM was sent successfully on sidechain 2.

 interoperability_ccmSendSuccess (height: 772 index: 8 topics: 045043174c97f508b711d9be0ec57ed60009ea83b57b2a665cef8c99420b9fcbb2, 04000002, 04000001, 5fc4e869feb87e83801adee1c5ca44a9c71fa10b6668021abed48d73864bd69f)

    "status": 0
  }
}
----

Next, go to the events of the Dashboard of *sidechain 1* and look for the following event:

 interoperability_ccmProcessed (height: 335 index: 3 topics: ab36b23bce5e2a0cebe9131c5b3bddfd8132e9367f1cf9a95875ae74b8ca3909, f092606d704d8a205bf2d702119c4761e3cb8cc22197fd28411f28fae9aa4d98, 04000002, 04000001)

.Dashboard sidechain 1
[source,json]
----
{
  "ccm": {
    "module": "hello",
    "crossChainCommand": "crossChainReact",
    "nonce": "1",
    "fee": "100000000",
    "sendingChainID": "04000002",
    "receivingChainID": "04000001",
    "params": "080112296c736b367134747a79657633386666776d66756263746163717a6f667962377a326f667266666d33791a0772656163746564",
    "status": 0
  },
  "result": 0,
  "code": 0
}
----

If there is an event similar to the above example, it means that the CCM from sidechain 2 was successfully processed on sidechain 1.

Once the CCM is received and executed on the node, it is possible to request the reaction on sidechain 1 with the endpoint `hello_getReactions` which we implement in the section xref:{url_build_executeccm_endoint}[Creating a new endpoint for getting reactions for a Hello message].

.Sidechain 1:
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run endpoint:invoke hello_getReactions '{"address":"lskmjwp8z88avvxn4voktmx8cu9wk4opjkna5owt5"}'
----

.Response, after one account has liked the message
----
{"reactions":{"likes":[{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,101,154,216,166,239,226,225,198,252,61,66,236,115,108,201,97,49,120,140]}]}}
----

By receiving this response from the blockchain store of sidechain 1, it is verified that the cross-chain reaction to Hello messages was implemented successfully.

=== Tips for debugging the interoperability example

TIP: Remember to adjust the value `--data-path` to the correct path for the respective node.
The endpoints can be invoked from any node CLI, and will always respond with data from the node specified in the `data-path`.

==== How to get the last sent CCM

To get the last sent CCM on a chain, invoke the `chainConnector_getLastSentCCM` endpoint.

.pos-sidechain-example-two
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run endpoint:invoke chainConnector_getLastSentCCM --pretty --data-path=~/.lisk/mainchain-node-one
----

==== How to authorize the chain connector plugin

In case it is necessary to restart the nodes, it is necessary to manually authorize the chain connector plugin again.
Otherwise, it will not be possible to send CCUs between chains.

.Authorize sidechain 2
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run endpoint:invoke 'chainConnector_authorize' '{"password": "lisk", "enable": true }' --data-path=~/.lisk/pos-sidechain-example-two
----

.Authorize sidechain 1
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run endpoint:invoke 'chainConnector_authorize' '{"password": "lisk", "enable": true }' --data-path=~/.lisk/pos-sidechain-example-one
----

.Authorize mainchain 1
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run endpoint:invoke 'chainConnector_authorize' '{"password": "lisk", "enable": true }' --data-path=~/.lisk/mainchain-node-one

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run endpoint:invoke 'chainConnector_authorize' '{"password": "lisk", "enable": true }' --data-path=~/.lisk/mainchain-node-two

==== How to reset the interoperability example

To completely reset the interop example, and start fresh, there is a very handy command which will perform all the necessary steps for you:

[source,bash]
----
./start_example --reset
----

==== How to monitor the nodes

This small script monitors the connections between mainchain and sidechain nodes.

[source,bash]
----
./monitor
