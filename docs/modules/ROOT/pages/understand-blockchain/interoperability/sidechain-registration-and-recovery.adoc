== Life Cycle of a Sidechain

A xref:{url_understand_interop_sidechains}[sidechain] is always in one of the following three states:

. <<sidechain-registration,registered>>,
. <<active-sidechains,active>>, or
. <<terminated-sidechains,terminated>>.

== Sidechain registration

.Sidechain registration flow chart
image:understand-blockchain/interop/sidechain-registration.png[,300,role="right"]

//TODO: Add link to Lisk Mainchain page once it is created
The first step for sidechain to become interoperable with other sidechains and the Lisk Mainchain, is to register itself to the mainchain.

A sidechain is registered by performing the following steps:

. <<sidechain-registration-on-the-lisk-mainchain>>
. <<mainchain-registration-on-a-sidechain>>

NOTE: After a sidechain has been registered on the mainchain, it does not need to follow the <<liveness-condition>>, until the <<first-cross-chain-update>> has been included on the mainchain.

=== Sidechain registration on the Lisk Mainchain
A sidechain can be registered by any user account on the mainchain that has adequate funds to pay the required transaction fee.

TIP: Please check out the guide xref:{url_build_regsidechain_mainchain}[How to register a sidechain on the mainchain] for a step-by-step explanation about the process.

When a sidechain is registered on the mainchain, this creates new entries in the interoperability related data stores of the mainchain:

. A new sidechain account in the <<chain-substore>>.
. A new channel to the sidechain in the <<channel-substore>>.
. The list of active validators on the sidechain in the <<chain-validators-substore>>.
. An outbox root in the <<outbox-root-substore>>
. A new entry in the <<registered-names-substore>> for the sidechain.

=== Mainchain registration on a sidechain
Once the sidechain has been registered on the mainchain, a similar registration process should happen in the sidechain before the interoperable channel is opened between the two chains.

TIP: Please check out the guide xref:{url_build_regsidechain_sidechain}[How to register the mainchain on the sidechain] for a step-by-step explanation about the process.

When the mainchain is registered on a sidechain, this creates new entries in the interoperability related data stores of the sidechain.

. A mainchain account in the <<chain-substore>>.
. A new channel to the mainchain in the <<channel-substore>>.
. The list of active validators on the mainchain in the <<chain-validators-substore>>.
. An outbox root in the <<outbox-root-substore>>
. It also initializes the <<own-chain-substore>> on the sidechain.

=== Registration CCM
Every time that a sidechain is registered on the mainchain and vice versa, a corresponding "registration" CCM is created and appended to the chain outbox.
The role of the registration cross-chain message is to allow for a safe activation of the channel between the sending and receiving chains.
It guarantees that when the CCU activating the channel is executed, a registration transaction has been included on the partner chain as well.

When a sidechain is registered on the mainchain, an ecosystem-wide chain ID and name are assigned to this chain.
The chain name, network ID, and the token used for the message fees are included in a registration message.
When the first cross-chain update containing messages is sent to the sidechain, the equality between the properties in the registration message and the ones in the interoperability store is verified.

== Active sidechains
If a sidechain receives the <<first-cross-chain-update>> from the mainchain, the status of the sidechain changes from `registered` to `active`.

This change means, that the receiving chain is now available to receive cross-chain messages and can interact with the sending chain.

At this point, the status of the sidechain account on the mainchain is updated to `active` and the <<liveness-condition>> is then enforced.
The liveness condition requires active sidechains to prove their liveness once every 30 days by including a CCU in the mainchain, or the sidechain account is terminated.

NOTE: *The liveness condition only needs to be fulfilled on the mainchain.*
That means, the mainchain account on the sidechain is not terminated, if the mainchain doesn't send a CCU to the sidechain within 30 days.

=== First Cross-chain Update
The first cross-chain update containing messages from a given chain has a special function:
It will change the sending chain status in the chain account from `registered` to `active`.

There are some things to consider when sending the first CCU:

. It must contain a non-empty certificate
. The certificate is only valid if it allows the sidechain account to remain <<live-sidechains,live>> for at least 15 days.

When a sidechain is started and registered, the sidechain developers might decide to not activate the sidechain straight away (maybe to do further testing).
It could happen then (intentionally or not) that an old block header (almost 30 days old) is submitted to the mainchain to activate the sidechain.
This could result in the sidechain being terminated for liveness failure very soon after the activation (maybe only a few minutes later).

****
To prevent this issue (and without any significant drawbacks) *the first cross-chain update to be submitted on the mainchain must contain a certificate less than 15 days old.*
****
The sidechain has therefore at least 15 days to submit the next cross-chain update to the mainchain and start the regular posting of cross-chain updates.

=== Live sidechains

A sidechain is  considered to be `live` if the following applies:

. on the mainchain: a chain is live if chain account exists, is not terminated and the last certificate was submitted less than 30 days ago;
. on the sidechain: a chain is live if no "terminated state" account exists and no chain account with status `terminated` exists.

== Terminated sidechains

When a sidechain is terminated, no cross-chain messages can be exchanged with it anymore.

Effectively, the sidechain is disconnected from the rest of the ecosystem, and assets (like tokens) cannot be moved to and from it anymore.
In particular, this means that users can not send the assets they were holding on the sidechain back to the original native chain (the chain where the asset was created).
The <<sidechain-recovery>> mechanism addresses this problem.

An active sidechain is terminated, if it fulfills any of the <<termination-causes>> described below.
When a chain is terminated, a "terminated state" account is created in the <<terminated-state-substore>>, storing the last certified state root of the terminated chain.

Any cross-chain messages targeting a terminated chain will be bounced back to the mainchain instead of being forwarded.
When this happens, a <<sidechain-terminated-ccm>> is emitted by the mainchain, targeting the original sending chain.
When this message is processed, the chain is also terminated on the sending chain, blocking future messages to the terminated sidechain.

[CAUTION]
====
*The termination of a sidechain is permanent* and cannot be undone.

However, users can recover their tokens and CCMs from a terminated sidechain.
For more details on this topic, read <<sidechain-recovery>> covered later on this page.
====

=== Termination causes

A sidechain is terminated for the following reasons:

. The sidechain breaks the <<liveness-condition>>.
. The sidechain is <<sending-malicious-ccms>>.
. The sidechain is <<violating-the-lisk-interoperability-protocol>>.

==== Liveness condition

The liveness condition is defined as follows:

Active sidechains are required to prove their liveness to the mainchain at least once every 30 days.
This is done by including a CCU on the mainchain.

NOTE: *The liveness condition only needs to be fulfilled on the mainchain.*
That means, the mainchain account on the sidechain is not terminated, if the mainchain doesn't send a CCU to the sidechain within 30 days.

Whenever a sidechain has violated the liveness condition, any user can submit a <<terminate-sidechain-for-liveness-command>> on the mainchain, and this will result in the sidechain being terminated.
This rule guarantees that users do not send funds to inactive sidechains and that users who have tokens in a sidechain which stops communicating with the ecosystem can recover their tokens.

==== Sending malicious CCMs

A sidechain is terminated, if it posts a CCU containing one or multiple malicious xref:{url_ccm}[CCMs].
Certain xref:{url_understand_module}[modules] of a sidechain client have the ability to terminate a sidechain account.
If a module receives a CCM that it considers to be malicious, it can call the  xref:{url_lip_45_terminatechain}[`terminateChain`] method of the Interoperability module to terminate the sidechain.

NOTE: Notice that a sidechain terminated for this reason is not terminated in the whole ecosystem.
For example, it could very well still be active and able to exchange messages with other chains.
However, communication with the sidechain that terminated it is interrupted.


==== Violating the Lisk Interoperability protocol

It is also possible for a sidechain to be terminated, if it violates the Lisk Interoperability protocol.

Note that the Interoperability module is designed in such a way that no channel should be terminated while the sidechain is respecting the Lisk interoperability protocol.
If a sidechain uses the Lisk Interoperability module, this should never happen.

But in case another custom module is used for interoperability, and it sends for example CCUs that don't follow the expected format, this can also lead to the termination of the sidechain.

=== Terminate Sidechain For Liveness command

The {url_typedoc_interop_terminate4liveness}[Terminate Sidechain For Liveness^] command is used to terminate a sidechain that violated the liveness condition.
The timestamp of the last certificate provided by the sidechain is checked against the current timestamp.
If the difference is greater than the maximum allowed timespan, the sidechain is terminated.

This command can only be submitted on the mainchain.

=== Sidechain Terminated CCM

The role of the sidechain terminated cross-chain message is to inform sidechains that another sidechain has been terminated on the mainchain and is unable to receive messages.
The message contains the ID of the terminated chain as well as the last certified state root of the terminated sidechain (as certified on the mainchain).
This value is used for the creation of the terminated state account (on the sidechain receiving the CCM), allowing state recoveries.

This message allows to inform sidechains about other terminated sidechains efficiently.
Indeed, this message will automatically trigger the creation of the terminated sidechain account as soon as the first message is unable to be delivered.
This also prevents further messages to be sent to already terminated sidechains.

=== Channel Terminated CCM

A "channel terminated" CCM is sent to chains which have been terminated.

The role of the "channel terminated" message is to inform chains that their channel has been terminated on the mainchain.
The chain receiving this message can then also close the channel to the mainchain.
This is helpful in preventing users from sending transactions to a chain whilst the cross-chain update transaction will be invalid.

=== Pending CCMs

If a sidechain is terminated, it can happen that some CCMs have been sent to the sidechain before the sending chain was aware that the sidechain is terminated.
Hence, this includes all the CCMs whose indices are larger than the last message index that the receiving sidechain reported to have included in its inbox on the mainchain.

Those CCMs that cannot be transmitted to the terminated chain anymore, and remain in the outbox on the mainchain are also called *pending CCMs*.

Pending CCMs can easily be recovered, please see <<ccm-recovery,CCM recovery>> for more information.

== Sidechain recovery

The sidechain recovery process allows users to recover assets like tokens or NFTs from a terminated sidechain.
Additionally, pending messages that were stuck unprocessed in the outbox of the terminated chain can be recovered as well, and their effect is reverted on the sending chain.

NOTE: No connection or communication to the terminated sidechain is required to complete the recovery.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For the sidechain recovery process, it is not important who is sending the recovery transactions:
The recovery process happens independently of the sender, and tokens and assets will always be recovered for the correct accounts.
That means, it is not possible to steal any tokens from a terminated chain by recovering them.

Furthermore, this makes it possible to provide <<recovery-as-a-service>> to users, to simplify the recovery process further.
====

=== Recovery process from the mainchain

On the mainchain, users can perform the following recoveries:

State recovery::
In case any tokens or other assets are stored on another sidechain and this sidechain gets terminated, the assets can to be recovered from the terminated sidechain.

[#ccm-recovery]
CCM recovery::
It is possible to recover any <<pending-ccms>> that may have been unprocessed in the outbox of the terminated chain.
Subsequently, their effect can be reverted on the sending chain.
+
However, it is important to note that users are not guaranteed to recover their CCMs in every situation.
Certain state information of the terminated sidechain might have been modified before the termination occurred, and this would make the recovered CCM application fail.
For example, in the case whereby escrowed LSK exists in the sidechain account on the mainchain, which could have been subtracted by prior malicious behavior in the terminated sidechain.

The recovery process for on the mainchain works as follows:

.Recovery process from the mainchain.
image::understand-blockchain/interop/recovery_mainchain.png[align="center",width=500]

1.State recovery::
The sidechain is terminated by submitting a <<terminate-sidechain-for-liveness-command>>, or violating the Token module protocol.
a. A "terminated state" account containing the last certified state root of the sidechain is created in the state.
b. A User can start recovering assets with a <<recover-state>> command.

2.CCM recovery::
A <<initialize-message-recovery>> command is then sent.
This command contains the inbox size of the mainchain stored on the terminated sidechain, which indicates how many cross-chain messages were processed.
a. A "terminated outbox" account is created in the <<terminated-outbox-substore>>.
This contains the outbox root of the terminated sidechain channel, and the inbox size provided with the <<initialize-message-recovery>> command.
b. A user can now recover pending messages with a <<recover-message>> command.

=== Recovery process from a sidechain

On a sidechain, users can perform the following recoveries:

State recovery::
In case any tokens or other assets are stored on another sidechain and this sidechain gets terminated, the assets can to be recovered from the terminated sidechain.

.Recoverable modules
[NOTE]
====
State changes can only be recovered on a sidechain, if the module targeted by the CCM supports the recovery.
Recoverable modules expose a `recover` method if the recovery is supported, like for example the Token module, and the NFT module.

For custom modules, it is therefore recommended to always implement a `recover` method into a module, if the module supports cross-chain transactions.
====

On a sidechain, the process flow can occur in 3 scenarios which are described below.

==== Scenario 1: Violation of a module protocol

If a sidechain is <<sending-malicious-ccms>> which are breaking the protocol of the corresponding module on the receiving chain, the chain will notice this during the validation of the CCM.
The receiving chain will then terminate account of the sending chain.

The recovery process for this scenario 1 works as follows:

image:understand-blockchain/interop/recovery_sidechain_1.png[role="right",width=360]

a. A "terminated state" account containing the mainchain last certified state root is created in the sidechain state.
b. An <<initialize-state-recovery>> command is sent.
This command contains the last certified state root (on the mainchain), of the terminated sidechain and an inclusion proof against the mainchain state root stored in the "terminated state" account.
c. A user is able to recover assets native to the sidechain with a <<recover-state>> command.

==== Scenario 2: Receiving a "sidechain terminated" CCM
A sidechain receives a <<sidechain-terminated-ccm>> from the mainchain, indicating that a cross-chain message could not be delivered because the receiving chain was terminated.
This CCM contains the last certified state root (on the mainchain), of the terminated sidechain.
The receiving chain will then terminate account of the corresponding sidechain.

The recovery process for this scenario 2 works as follows:

image::understand-blockchain/interop/recovery_sidechain_3.png[role="right",width=360]

a. A "terminated state" account containing the sidechain’s last certified state root is created in the state.
However, it is important to note that in this case, the terminated sidechain state root is set immediately, and there is no need for a <<initialize-state-recovery>> command.
b. A user can recover assets native to the sidechain with a <<recover-state>> command.

==== Scenario 3: Termination on the mainchain
Sometimes it can happen that a sidechain is terminated on the mainchain, and still active on other sidechains.
That is, because the mainchain does not inform other sidechains immediately about a termination.
If a sidechain then tries to send a CCU to a sidechain that is already terminated on the mainchain, the CCU will be rejected by the mainchain, and it will respond with a <<sidechain-terminated-ccm>> like described in <<scenario-2-receiving-a-sidechain-terminated-ccm>>.

In case it is already known that a sidechain is terminated by the users, they can avoid scenario 2, where a CCU is rejected, and directly initialize the <<state-recovery>>.

The recovery process for this scenario 3 works as follows:

image::understand-blockchain/interop/recovery_sidechain_2.png[role="right",width=360]

a. A <<initialize-state-recovery>> command is sent.
This command contains the last certified state root (on the mainchain), of the terminated sidechain and an inclusion proof against the last certified mainchain state root, proving the termination.
b. A "terminated state" account containing the sidechain’s last certified state root is created in the state.
c. A user can recover assets that are native to the sidechain with a <<recover-state>> command.

=== Example: Recovery Process

In order to summarize the recovery process, a brief example of recovering assets/tokens from the state of a terminated sidechain is provided below:

NOTE: Please keep in mind, that there are certain data-availability requirements necessary to prepare a recovery transaction.
Please read the following section <<recovery-as-a-service>> for more information on the topic.

1. A sidechain is terminated on the mainchain due to inactivity.
2. The last certified state root, i.e. the state root contained in the last certificate received from the sidechain, is stored in the terminated state account of the sidechain.
3. The user can recover the assets/tokens by sending a state recovery command.
This command contains an inclusion proof, proving the user balance on the sidechain against the state root stored in the terminated state account.
4. The funds are credited to the user's account on the mainchain.
5. Finally, the state root of the terminated sidechain is then updated accordingly.

=== Recovery-as-a-Service
The following information is required to prepare a recovery transaction:

Message recovery commands::
* Access to the cross-chain messages in the sidechain outbox.
* The entire tree of the sidechain outbox to be able to provide the inclusion proof.

State recovery commands::
* Access to the specific asset to recover from the sidechain
* The entire state tree authenticated by the last certified state root to be able to provide the inclusion proof.

Furthermore, this information has to be kept updated every time a recovery command is processed.
Due to this fact, third-party services could offer to recover assets and messages on behalf of users.
These services would run a mainchain and sidechain node to provide the data availability, possibly in exchange for a small fee.

=== Recovery commands

==== Initialize State Recovery

The {url_typedoc_interop_init_recovery}[Initialize State Recovery^] command sets the sidechain state root in the "terminated state" account, so that state recovery commands can be issued.

A sidechain account can be terminated on a sidechain using the `terminateChain` function exposed by the Interoperability module.
In this case, the state root is generally not available and the terminated state account is created without setting the sidechain state root.
Instead, the account stores the mainchain state root at the time of termination.

A state recovery initialization command can be posted afterwards to set the sidechain state root by giving an inclusion proof against this mainchain state root.
It contains an inclusion proof against the mainchain state root stored in the terminated state account, proving the value of the state root of the terminated sidechain.
Any user on the corresponding sidechain can send a transaction with this command and initiate the state recoveries with respect to the terminated sidechain.
Further information including, the `createTerminatedStateAccount` function can be found in {url_lip_45}[LIP 0045].

NOTE: This command can only be submitted on a sidechain.

This command has two purposes: It can be used to...

. ...set the state root of a "terminated state" account on a sidechain, or
. ...to terminate another sidechain directly.

// In the first case, the command contains an inclusion proof against the mainchain state root stored in the terminated state account, proving the value of the state root of the terminated sidechain.
// In the second case, the command contains an inclusion proof against the mainchain state root, proving that another sidechain is either terminated or the <<liveness-condition>> is violated.

==== Recover State
The {url_typedoc_interop_state_recovery}[Recover State^] command is used to recover assets (for example fungible and non-fungible tokens) from a terminated sidechain.

The user proves the existence of an entry in the terminated sidechain state with an inclusion proof against the state root stored in the <<terminated-state-substore,sidechain terminated>> account.

The recovery of the state is then handled by the relevant module (for example, the token module would refund the user) and the state root is updated.

The following information is required to recover assets from a terminated chain:

* Access to the specific asset to recover from the sidechain
* The entire state tree authenticated by the last certified state root to be able to provide the inclusion proof.

==== Initialize Message Recovery
Once a <<terminated-state-substore,terminated state>> account has been created on the mainchain, users can send this command to initialize the corresponding terminated outbox account in the <<terminated-outbox-substore>>.
This command contains the channel account of the mainchain stored in the state of the terminated sidechain and an inclusion proof for it against the state root stored in the corresponding terminated state account.

//The mainchain channel data is required to get the number of messages that were processed in the terminated sidechain (corresponding to the inbox size of the channel).
The following information is required to initialize message recovery on the mainchain:

* `chainID`: The ID of the sidechain whose terminated outbox account is to be initialized.
* `channel`: The channel of this chain stored on the terminated sidechain.
* `bitmap`: The bitmap of the inclusion proof of the channel in the sidechain state tree.
* `siblingHashes`: The sibling hashes of the inclusion proof of the channel in the sidechain state tree.

==== Recover Message
The {url_typedoc_interop_message_recovery}[Recover Message^] command is used to recover any <<pending-ccms>> from the outbox of a terminated sidechain.

The user proves with an inclusion proof validated against the outbox root stored in the terminated outbox account that the message is in the terminated sidechain outbox.
The message nonce is compared to the size of the inbox (also stored in the terminated outbox account) to check that the message had not been processed yet.

The <<recover-ccm>> is then bounced back to the original sending chain or processed directly if the sending chain is the mainchain.
When the recovery process is completed, a corresponding <<recover-event>> is emitted.

The following information is required to recover pending CCMs:

* Access to the cross-chain messages in the sidechain outbox.
* The entire tree of the sidechain outbox to be able to provide the inclusion proof.

=== Recover CCM

The Recover CCM is sent from the mainchain to the sending chain to facilitate the <<ccm-recovery,CCM recovery>> on a sidechain.

The module responsible for recovering the dedicated assets (e.g. the Token module) will then emit a <<recover-event>> to inform the network about the performed recovery.

=== Recover event

The {url_lip_51_recoverevent}[Recover event^] is emitted by when a <<ccm-recovery,CCM recovery>> is performed.

== Interoperability data substores

Each sidechain stores data related to cross-chain interoperability in the xref:{url_understand_statemachine_stores}[Interoperability data store], maintained by the xref:{url_typedoc_interop_module}[Interoperability module].

The interoperability store consists of several substores, as shown in the diagram below.

.The Interoperability module store
image::understand-blockchain/interop/interop-store.png[,500]

Each box in the above diagram represents a substore, where the `storeKey` --> `storeValue` relation is indicated.

Each substore and its contained data is described in detail below.

=== Outbox root substore
The "outbox root" substore holds the root of the Merkle tree containing the messages targeting the respective partner chain for every registered sidechain.

It is initialized on the respective chain as part of the <<sidechain-registration>> process.

[NOTE]
====
The outbox root property is duplicated and additionally stored separately from all other properties of the chain account.
Storing the outbox root with a different substore prefix allows to separate the subtree corresponding to the outbox roots from the rest of the data in the interoperability store.
This choice allows for shorter inclusion proofs for the outbox root, as the other properties of the Interoperability module are not needed to recalculate the state root if the outbox root is known.
In particular, the inclusion proof contained in a CCU from a sidechain posted on the mainchain will contain only one hash.
====

[%collapsible]
====
Key:: Each store key is set to the ID of the partner chain `chainID`.

Value::
Each entry in the "outbox root" substore includes the following property:

* `root`: The root of the underlying Merkle tree of the partner chain outbox.
This value is initialized to `sha256(b"")`.
====

=== Own chain substore

The "own chain" substore stores the name and ID of the respective chain.

On the Lisk *mainchain*, the own chain account is present by default, and set to an object with properties:

[source,js]
----
{
    name: "lisk_mainchain",
    chainID: 00000000,
    nonce: 0
}
----

On a *sidechain*, the own chain account is initialized as part of the <<mainchain-registration-on-a-sidechain>>.

[%collapsible]
====
Key:: The store key is set to an empty string `""`.

Value::
The "own chain" substore consists of the following properties:

* `name`: The name of the sidechain registered on the mainchain with the sidechain registration command.
* `chainID`: The xref:{url_understand_interop_chainid}[chain ID] assigned to the sidechain on the mainchain after processing the sidechain registration command.
* `nonce`: The chain nonce, an incremental integer indicating the total number of CCMs sent from the chain.
====

=== Chain substore
The chain substore holds the chain accounts of other partner chains.

It is initialized on the respective chain as part of the <<sidechain-registration>> process.

* On the mainchain, the store contains accounts of all registered sidechains.
* On a sidechain, the store contains a mainchain account.

[%collapsible]
====
Key:: Each store key is set to the ID of the partner chain `chainID`.

Value::
Each entry in the chain account substore includes the following properties:

* `name`: This property corresponds to the name of the sidechain as a string of characters.
It has to be unique in the ecosystem and contain only characters from the set `[a-z0-9!@$&_.]`.
For the mainchain account on a sidechain, this property is initialized to the string `"lisk_mainchain"`.
For a sidechain account on the mainchain, this property is set by the sender of the xref:{url_typedoc_interop_register_sidechain}[Register Sidechain command].
* `lastCertificate`: This property holds some information from the certificate posted contained in the last CCU from the partner chain.
It is an object containing the following properties:
** `height`: The height contained in the last certificate from the partner chain.
It is used to validate a certificate{fn_lip53} (certificates must contain block headers with increasing heights).
The default value of this property is `0`.
** `timestamp`: The timestamp contained in the last certificate from the partner chain.
On the mainchain, it is used to check that the sidechain chain fulfills the <<liveness-condition>>.
The default value of this property is `0`.
** `stateRoot`: The state root contained in the last certificate from the partner chain.
It is used to validate the inclusion proof of the cross-chain messages contained in a CCU and to verify the validity of the token recovery command.
The default value of this property is `sha256(b"")`.
** `validatorsHash`: The validators hash contained in the last certificate from the partner chain.
This value always corresponds to the hash calculated from the validators data substore entry for the partner chain.
The default value of this property is the constant `sha256(b"")`.
* `status`: This property stores the current status of the partner chain account.
As explained in <<life-cycle-of-a-sidechain>>, there are 3 possible statuses: `active`(0), `registered`(1), and `terminated`(2).
The default value of this property is `0`, corresponding to the `registered` status.

=== Channel substore
The channel substore holds information about the inbox and outbox with other partner chains.

It is initialized on the respective chain as part of the <<sidechain-registration>> process.

* On the mainchain, the store contains channels to all registered sidechains.
* On a sidechain, the store contains a channel to the mainchain.

[%collapsible]
====
Key:: Each store key is set to the ID of the partner chain `chainID`.

Value::
Each entry in the channel substore includes the following properties:

* `inbox`: The data structure containing information about the cross-chain messages received from the partner chain, organized in a regular Merkle tree (specified for the Lisk protocol in [LIP 0031](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0031.md#regular-merkle-trees)).
The underlying Merkle tree of the inbox is initialized as an empty tree, as defined in [LIP 0031](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0031.md).
It contains the following properties:
** `root`:  The root of the Merkle tree.
The default value of this property is `sha256(b"")`.
** `appendPath`: An array of hashes necessary to append new data to the tree efficiently.
The default value of this property is an empty array.
** `size`: The current size of the tree, i.e. the number of cross-chain messages received from the partner chain and processed.
The default value of this property is 0.
* `outbox`: The data structure containing information about the cross-chain messages sent to the partner chain, organized in a regular Merkle tree.
The underlying Merkle tree of the outbox is initialized as an empty tree, as defined in [LIP 0031](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0031.md).
It contains the following properties:
** `root`:  The root of the Merkle tree.
The default value of this property is `sha256(b"")`.
** `appendPath`: An array of hashes necessary to append new data to the tree efficiently.
The default value of this property is an empty array.
** `size`: The current size of the tree, i.e. the number of cross-chain messages sent to the partner chain.
The default value of this property is 0.
* `partnerChainOutboxRoot`: The value of this property is set to the outbox root computed from the last CCU from the partner chain.
It is used to validate the cross-chain messages contained in a future CCU when the CCU does not certify a new outbox root.
The default value of this property is the constant `sha256(b"")`.
* `messageFeeTokenID`: This property is the token ID of the token used to pay for the cross-chain message fees.
The default value is `messageFeeTokenID = Token.getTokenIDLSK()`, corresponding to the LSK token.
* `minReturnFeePerByte`: This property is the minimum fee per byte to automatically send back a CCM from the partner chain in case of execution errors.
In particular, the CCM fee must be larger or equal than the product of its size in bytes and `minReturnFeePerByte`.
The value used in channels between mainchain and sidechains is `minReturnFeePerByte` = `1000` Beddows.
====

=== Chain validators substore

The "chain validators" substore holds information about the validators of other partner chains.

It is initialized on the respective chain as part of the <<sidechain-registration>> process.

* On the mainchain, the store contains lists of validators for all registered sidechains.
* On a sidechain, the store contains the list of the mainchain validators.

[%collapsible]
====
Key:: Each store key is set to the ID of the partner chain `chainID`.

Value::
Each entry in the "chain validators" substore includes the following properties:

* `activeValidators`: An array of objects corresponding to the set of validators eligible to sign the certificates from the partner chain.
Each entry contains the following properties:
** `blsKey`: The BLS public key used to sign certificates.
** `bftWeight`: An integer indicating the weight of the corresponding BLS public key for signing a certificate.
* `certificateThreshold`: An integer setting the required cumulative weight needed for the certificate signature to be valid.
For the mainchain account on a sidechain, the `activeValidators` and `certificateThreshold` properties are initialized by the mainchain registration command.
For a sidechain account on the mainchain, they are set by the sidechain registration command.
====

=== Terminated state substore

A *terminated state* account is created for a terminated chain on the mainchain or another sidechain ...

* ... as part of the `terminateChain` function,
* ... as part of the processing of a <<sidechain-terminated-ccm>>,
* ... as part of the processing of a <<channel-terminated-ccm>>,
* ... or as part of the processing of a <<recover-state>> command.

It is initialized with the information contained in the last sidechain certificate posted on the mainchain.

[%collapsible]
====
Key::
The store key is set to the ID of the terminated chain `chainID`.

Value::
Each entry in the "terminated state" substore includes the following properties:

* `stateRoot`: The state root of the terminated chain, where `chainID` is the chain ID of the terminated chain.
If the account is not initialized, it is set to `sha256(b"")` instead.
* `mainchainStateRoot`: The state root of the mainchain at the moment in which the chain was terminated.
If the account is initialized, it is set to `sha256(b"")` instead.
* `initialized`: A boolean value, indicating whether the terminated state account has been initialized, i.e. if the `stateRoot` property has been set.
====

=== Terminated outbox substore

A "terminated outbox" account is created for a terminated chain on the mainchain as part of the processing of a <<recover-message>> command.

A data structure holding the outbox root along with the mainchain inbox size from the terminated sidechain, indicating the number of messages that were processed on it.

[%collapsible]
====
Key::
The store key is set to the ID of the terminated chain `chainID`.

Value::
Each entry in the "terminated outbox" substore includes the following properties:

* `outboxRoot`: The outbox root of the terminated chain, where `chainID` is the chain ID of the terminated chain.
* `outboxSize`: The outbox size of the terminated chain, where `chainID` is the chain ID of the terminated chain.
* `partnerChainInboxSize`: The number of cross-chain messages processed in the terminated chain, set to the `partnerChainInboxSize` property contained in the "Recover Message" command.
====

=== Registered names substore
In order to process sidechain registration commands more efficiently, it is convenient to store the names already registered in the ecosystem on the mainchain.
This way it is possible to quickly check the uniqueness of the sidechain name.

This substore contains the names of all chains in the ecosystem.

NOTE: The "registered names" substore is only present on the mainchain.

An entry for the Lisk Mainchain is present by default.
Any new entry for a sidechain is created as part of the <<sidechain-registration-on-the-lisk-mainchain>> in the "registered names" substore.

[%collapsible]
====
Key:: The chain name (String).

Value::
Each entry in the "registered names" substore includes the following properties:

* `chainID`: The ID of the chain.
