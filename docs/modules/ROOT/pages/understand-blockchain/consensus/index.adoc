A consensus protocol is the protocol for xref:{url_glossary_validator}[validators] to **agree on one chain of blocks**.
In particular, the consensus protocol defines,

* *who* is allowed to add a new block to the blockchain,
* how validators choose the *chain* to which they add a new block and
* when a block and all included transactions are **final**, i.e., irrevocably deemed part of the blockchain.

TIP: See also xref:{url_intro_consensus}[Intro > How blockchain works > Consensus mechanisms].

== Consensus protocol in Lisk

In the Lisk SDK, the different aspects of the consensus protocol are handled by different sub-protocols as outlined in the table below. 

TIP: There are multiple available protocols for the consensus domain `Block proposal` that you can choose from, to fit the specific use case.

|Domain|Protocol|Responsible for

|Block proposal
|xref:{url_understand_dpos}[Lisk DPoS] or xref:{url_understand_poa}[Lisk PoA]
|* **Choosing validators**: Deciding who can be validator, i.e. who is allowed to add new blocks to the blockchain.

|Agreement on one chain
|xref:{url_understand_bft}[Lisk BFT]
|* **xref:{url_glossary_fork}[Fork] choice rule**: Determining how validators choose the chain to which they add a new block.
* **Block finalization**: Determining when a block (and all included transactions) is irrevocably deemed part of the blockchain.

|Certificates
|xref:{url_understand_certificates}[Lisk Certificates]
|* **Certificate generation**: Certificates are generated for finalized blocks.
Certificates are crucial for submitting cross-chain updates to other blockchains as they attest outgoing cross-chain messages and changes of validators.
