== The Config object

The values below are the *default values*.
They will be used automatically when starting the application without specifying a specific configuration.
To change them, override the specific default values with custom values when initializing the application. Please see xref:{url_guide_config}[Modify default values].

<76> Default password for dummy delegates, only used on local development networks.
<77> If true, enables syncing, (fallback for broadcasts).
<78> How many blocks to load from a peer or the database during verification.
<79> Integer.

Otherwise, the application continues normal execution.
<80> Contains network options for the node.
<81> Websocket port of the node.
<82> The host IP which the P2P server should listen on for inbound connections.
This value is passed directly to the underlying Node.js server.

<83> A list of peers to use as seeds when starting the node for the first time.
This should be an array of objects in the following form: [{ip: '123.123.123.123', wsPort: 7000}, {ip: '111.111.111.111', wsPort: 8000}]
<84> IP or address of the seed peer.
<85> Port of the seed peer.
<86> A list of peers to blacklist.

<87> IP or address of the blacklisted peer.
<88> A list of peers to stay constantly connected to.

<89> IP or address of the blacklisted peer.
<90> A list of peers which should never be banned.
This should be an array of objects in the following form: [{ip: '123.123.123.123'}, {ip: '111.111.111.111'}]
<91> IP or address of the blacklisted peer.
<92> Time interval(ms), the time that it takes the nodes to perform peer discovery.
<93> The maximum number of inbound peers/connections which the node should have.
This should be an integer.
Peers which initiate the connection to the node will be added to the node’s inbound list.
<94> The maximum number of outbound peers/connections which the node should have.
This should be an integer.
The node will keep trying to connect to new peers until it reaches maxOutboundConnections.
<95> The amount of milliseconds a peer can be banned for; in the case whereby it's reputation score falls below 0.
<96> How frequently, (in milliseconds) it takes to check and re-populate the outbound list, (as peers may drop out over time).
<97> When broadcasting a message such as a block or transaction to peers, this number determines how many peers the message will be to sent to at any one time.
<98> This number indicates the amount of peer information which the node will send back to a peer; once that peer requests the node’s peer list.
<99> This number indicates the maximum amount of peer information which can be received from a single peer, in order to populate our peer directory during the discovery.
<100> The maximum size in bytes, (integer) of a single peer information object.
A peer information object has a flexible schema, and can contain custom properties/data about the node.
<101> The maximum size in bytes, (integer) of any kind of message from a peer.
If the peer tries to send a message greater than this value, it will be immediately disconnected.
<102> When a node tries to make an RPC against a peer, (and expects a response), this value determines the maximum amount of time, (in milliseconds) that the node will wait to receive a response from the peer.
If the peer does not respond in time, then the RPC will fail with an error.
<103> When a node tries to connect to a peer, this value determines the maximum amount of time, (in milliseconds) that the node will wait to complete the handshake with the peer.
If the peer does not complete the handshake in time then the connection will be closed.
<104> This represents the low-level WebSocket engine which the node should use, (this is for advanced users).
Possible values are "ws", (default and recommended value),and "uws" (for increased performance, however this is not compatible with all systems).
