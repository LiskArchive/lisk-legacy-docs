== Configuration

Show Lisk Commander config:

[source,bash]
----
lisk config:show
----

[source,js]
----
{
    "json": true, <1>
    "api": {
        "nodes": [], <2>
        "network": "main" <3>
    },
    "pretty": false <4>
}
----

<1> Provide output as json if set to true, otherwise output is table.
<2> Specify nodes to send requests.
<3> Specify a default network. It can be `main` or `test`.
<4> Pretty print JSON output if set to true.

=== Configure the network

[source,bash]
----
lisk config:set api.network <NETWORK>
----

Possible values for `<NETWORK>` are, `test` for Testnet, `main` for Mainnet, `alpha` for Alphanet and `beta` for Betanet.

TIP: If specific nodes were not specified for Lisk Commander, it will connect to pre-defined public nodes of the Lisk Mainnet or Testnet.

=== Configure specific nodes

Specify the node which will communicate with Lisk Commander.

In the case whereby more than one node is specified, it will use the first node as default, and the other nodes as a fallback if the first node does not respond.

[source,bash]
----
lisk config:set api.nodes https://127.0.0.1:4000,http://mynode.com:7000
----

See more examples with the xref:{url_commander_config}[`config` command] on the Commands page.

=== How to use a custom config file

The configuration file `config.json` is located in `lisk-sdk/commander/src/config.json`.
In order to store this file elsewhere, run Lisk Commander with the environmental variable `LISK_COMMANDER_CONFIG_DIR` set to the path of your choice.

=== Override config options

Some elements of this configuration can be overridden while executing a command, by using the following options:

[options="header",]
|===
|Setting |Option
|Use JSON output |`--json`
|Use table output |`--no-json`
|Pretty print JSON |`--pretty`
|Do not pretty print JSON |`--pretty false`
|===

See concrete examples on the xref:{url_commander_commands}[Commands page].
