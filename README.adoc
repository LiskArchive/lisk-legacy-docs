== Overview

Content::
The Content of the whole Lisk documentation is stored in branches:
+
----
docs-sdk
docs-core
----
Documentation for previous versions of the SDK and Core is stored in branches following the naming convention:
+
----
docs-core-VERSION
docs-sdk-VERSION
----
where `VERSION` is always referring to the corresponding software version.

UI::
The presentation of the documentation is stored completely seperate form the actual content.
It's stored on the `antora` branch.

Building::
The `build` branch stores the `site.yml` file, which is used to generate the Lisk Documentation using Antora.
