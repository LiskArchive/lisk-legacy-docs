On this page, we'll talk about how a registered validator can enable reward sharing with its stakers and how such rewards can be later claimed.

== What is reward sharing?

In the Lisk protocol, validators receive rewards for generating blocks.
The set of validators that generate blocks is chosen based on the total stake of each validator (self-stake and sum of staked amounts from stakers).

Rewards are shared between validators and stakers as follows: a certain part of the rewards is awarded to the validator as a commission.
The precise percentage of the commission is chosen by each validator; then, the remaining rewards are shared by the validator and the stakers proportionally to their staked amounts.

The reward-sharing mechanism is part of the PoS module. To learn more about how reward sharing works in Lisk Protocol, see {url_lip_70}[LIP 70^].

The values of all constants related to commissions are between *0* and *10000*, corresponding to percentages with two decimal places, which can be obtained by dividing the value by *100*. For example, a commission value of *1000*, corresponds to a *10%* commission.

Initially, after the validator's registration the commission of a validator is initialized with 100%.
Afterward, it can be decreased by submitting a commission change transaction. 

== Prerequisites and Background

* To earn rewards, a *staker* must stake LSKs for an active block-generating validator.
To learn more about staking, see xref:{url_staking_guide}[].

Once you successfully stake for a validator, you can see your stakes by invoking the xref:{url_getStaker}[pos_getStaker] endpoint.
Each time a validator becomes part of the block generation round, there are chances that the validator will be selected to generate an upcoming block. 

To check if the validator is in the list of active validators, look for the validator in the response of xref:{url_consensus_getbftparameters}[consensus_getBFTParameters].
If the validator is in the returned list then, soon your validator will be generating a block and as a result will earn rewards.

Block rewards are distributed after the `offset` block height is reached. By default, the value of offset is `2160`.
After reaching the offset height, rewards for each validator are credited to their account.
The estimated rewards of a validator can be checked via the xref:{url_getexpectedvalidatorrewards}[dynamicReward_getExpectedValidatorRewards] endpoint.

== Sharing rewards

=== Sharing via Lisk Desktop
To share rewards via Lisk Desktop, the validator should be logged in to their account and then perform the following steps:

. Go to *My validator profile*, and click on the edit icon right next to the current `Commission` value:
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/3.1.png["Click on edit commission",300]
+
. Type `85`, in the *Edit Commission* dialog box, and click on the *Confirm* button.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/3.2.png["Edit Commission",300]
+
. Lisk Desktop will display the *Transaction summary* including the existing and new value of commission.
If everything looks correct, click on the *Confirm* button.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/3.3.png["Transaction summary",300]
+
. Finally, enter the password to authenticate the change commission request, and then click on the *Confirm and sign* button.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/3.4.png["Authenticate",300]
. Lisk Desktop will display an *Edit commission successful* message after submitting the request successfully.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/3.5.png["Edit commission successful",300]
. Once the transaction is executed and the block is finalized, the updated commission value will be shown on the *My validator profile*.
+

=== Sharing via CLI

To share rewards via CLI, an active validator should create a `changeCommission` transaction to update the commission value.

. The validator should execute the following command to initiate the commission change process:
+
[tabs]
=====
Mainchain node::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core transaction:create pos changeCommission 1000000 --json --pretty  
----
--
Sidechain Node::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run transaction:create pos changeCommission 1000000 --json --pretty 
----
--
=====
+
. The *validator* should enter their `passphrase` and the `newCommission` value. 
In this example, the validator is set to keep *85%* of the rewards and share *15%* with their staker, hence the value of `8500`.
+
---- 
? Please enter passphrase:  [hidden]
? Please enter: newCommission:  8500

. The `changeCommission` command will return the transaction in the HEX string and JSON format.

== Claiming rewards

=== Claiming via Desktop


=== Claiming via CLI
After each block generated by the validator, both the validator and the staker(s) will earn a set percentage of rewards.
For validators, the Lisk Protocol automatically increments the `lockedBalance` and `availableBalance` of the validator's account.
However, a staker needs to claim their rewards via the following steps.

. Check available rewards by invoking the xref:{url_getclaimablerewards}[pos_getClaimableRewards] endpoint by passing the staker's `address` and the `tokenID`.
+
[source,json]

    "rewards": [

            "reward": "10000"
        }
    ]
}
----
+
. Any `reward` higher than `0` can be claimed by the staker by executing the `claimRewards` command.
