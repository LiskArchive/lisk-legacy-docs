Now that we have our core logic in place, it is time to create an endpoint for the HelloInfoPlugin.
The endpoint will fetch all the NewHello _messages_, _sender addresses_, and corresponding _height_ of the block for each event, as stored in the database.

== Creating an Endpoint

The endpoints of a plugin exist in an `endpoint.ts` file.
So, let's create an `endpoint.ts` file in the `hello_info` directory. 

This file will contain the `Endpoint` class and an endpoint `getMessageList()`.

The `Endpoint` class is based on the `BasePluginEndpoint` class, which is available in the `lisk-sdk` package.

.hello_client/src/app/plugins/hello_info/endpoint.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import {
    BasePluginEndpoint,
    PluginEndpointContext,
    db as liskDB,
    cryptography,
} from 'lisk-sdk';
import {
    getEventHelloInfo,
} from './db';

export class Endpoint extends BasePluginEndpoint {
    private _pluginDB!: liskDB.Database;

    // Initialize the database instance here
    public init(db: liskDB.Database) {
        this._pluginDB = db;
    }

    // [...]
}
----

Since the events data exists on an off-chain database, we must have an instance of the plugin's database inside the `Endpoint` class.

The way to do that is to create an instance of the Endpoint class inside the `HelloInfoPlugin` class and pass the database instance to the `endpoint.init()` method in the `load()` function.

.hello_client/src/app/plugins/hello_info/endpoint.ts
[source,typescript]
----
// [...]
import { Endpoint } from './endpoint';

export class HelloInfoPlugin extends BasePlugin<HelloInfoPluginConfig> {
	// [...]

    public endpoint = new Endpoint();

    // [...]

    // loads DB instance and initiates endpoint.
	public async load(): Promise<void> {
		// [...]

		this.endpoint.init(this._pluginDB);

		// [...]
	}

    // [...]
}
----

Next up is the endpoint function, every `public` function present in the `Endpoint` class gets registered to the sidechain client. Since the endpoint will return a list of all the hello messages, we call it `getMessageList()`.

The `getMessageList()` will have a `messageList` and a `data[]` which will house the information retrieved from the database.

.hello_client/src/app/plugins/hello_info/endpoint.ts
[source,typescript]
----
export class Endpoint extends BasePluginEndpoint {
    // [...]

    // Returns all Sender Addresses, Hello Messages, and Block Height of the block where the Hello Event was emitted.
    public async getMessageList(_context: PluginEndpointContext): Promise<unknown[]> {
        const data: {
            ID: number;
            senderAddress: string;
            message: string;
            blockHeight;
        }[] = [];
        // 1. Get all the stored events from the database.
        const messageList = await getEventHelloInfo(this._pluginDB);
        // 2. Push them into an array for presentation.
        for (const helloMessage of messageList) {
            data.push({
                ID: helloMessage.id.readUInt32BE(0),
                senderAddress: cryptography.address.getLisk32AddressFromAddress(helloMessage['senderAddress']),
                message: helloMessage['message'],
                blockHeight: helloMessage['height'],
            })
        }
        return data;
    }
}
----

The `getEventHelloInfo()` will return all the `newHello` events stored inside the database.
Once received, the endpoint will push each event's data into an array of objects and will return this array as a response.

[TIP]
====
It is worth mentioning that an endpoint can also have various input arguments. 
These arguments are passed via the `PluginEndpointContext` class available in `lisk-sdk`. If the endpoint doesn't require any arguments then, the request `"params": {}` property can be left empty.
The arguments passed can be accessed via `_context.ARGUMENT_EXAMPLE`, etc.

== Testing HelloInfoPlugin

Our implementation of HelloInfoPlugin is complete and it is time to test it out.
Create and send a hello message as described in xref:{url_send_transaction}[How to create a command â†’ Try the new command out].

Once a transaction is verified and becomes part of the block, wait for your plugin's sync interval to kick in. 
In our case, since we set the `syncInterval` configuration to 30 seconds (60000 milliseconds) in the *custom_config.json*, the sync will happen after every 30 seconds.

. If you started your node for the first time, you'll see that the plugin instantiates the _height_ in the database as shown in the following message:
+
----
** Height saved successfully in the database **
----

. After that, you should see that the plugin will set the initial value for the _counter_ as well.
+
----
** Counter saved successfully in the database **
----

. The `_syncChainEvents()` will then store the event, update the counter, and set the height of the block where it found an event.
+
----
** Event Data saved successfully in the database **
** Counter saved successfully in the database **
** Height saved successfully in the database **
----

. At the end of the loop, the `_syncChainEvents()` will again update the height as per the last checked block height.
+
----
** Height saved successfully in the database **
----

After the first initiation, the plugin will repeat step 3 in each sync interval if it finds a `newHello` event(s) to store.

=== Querying Saved Events
The former log messages suggest that the plugin has stored a few events in its database, so let's query them.
While the client is running, let's make an RPC request to the `helloInfo_getMessageList` endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:7887/rpc' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "helloInfo_getMessageList",
    "params": {
    }
}'
----

When the request is successful, the node will reply with something similar to the following:

[source,json]
----
{
    "id": "1",
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": [
        {
            "ID": 1,
            "senderAddress": "lsko5v2u2wjswjogxgxdr79c45kewprypouyaky76",
            "message": "Hello from Lisk.",
            "blockHeight": 22
        },
        {
            "ID": 2,
            "senderAddress": "lsko5v2u2wjswjogxgxdr79c45kewprypouyaky76",
            "message": "Hello from Lightcurve.",
            "blockHeight": 54
        }
    ]
}
----
