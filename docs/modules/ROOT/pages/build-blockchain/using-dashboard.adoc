How to conveniently interact with a blockchain application during development, by using the dashboard plugin.
// xref:{url_references_dashboard_plugin}[].

.Prerequisites
[NOTE]
====
To use this guide, it is assumed that the following criteria have been met:

. Lisk Commander is installed, and a basic Lisk application is already initialized, as explained in the guide xref:{url_guides_setup}[].
. A new module `HelloModule` is created, as explained in the guide xref:{url_guides_module}[].
. A new plugin `helloInfoPlugin` is created, as explained in the guide xref:{url_guides_plugin}[].
====

== Plugin registration

With Lisk v6, the default plugins come pre-installed after an application is initiated.
You can check the `package.json` file of the blockchain client to ensure the installation.

../hello_client/package.json
[source,json]
----
"dependencies": {
	"@liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin": "0.2.0",
	//[...]
},
----

Otherwise, you can install the dashboard plugin like this:

[source,bash]
----
npm i @liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin
----

Now open `plugins.ts`, import the Dashboard plugin, and register it with the application as shown below:

.src/app/plugins.ts
[source,typescript]
----
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-empty-function */
import { Application } from 'lisk-sdk';
import { DashboardPlugin } from '@liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin';
import { HelloInfoPlugin } from "./plugins/hello_info/hello_info_plugin";

export const registerPlugins = (app: Application): void => {
    app.registerPlugin(new HelloInfoPlugin());
    app.registerPlugin(new DashboardPlugin());
};
----

Save and close `plugins.ts`, and build the blockchain client again:

[source,bash]
----
npm run build
----

.Start the blockchain client with custom_config.json
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start --config=config/custom_config.json 
----

Wait until the application start has been completed.
Now it is possible to access the dashboard on the browser under `localhost: 4005`

You can also see the blockchain client logs to confirm the registration of the dashboard plugin.

[source,bash]
----
2023-07-28T08:42:18.189Z INFO XYZ.local application 92756 dashboard Loading in-memory plugin
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is essential to enable WS API and configure the `allowedMethods` property before registering the `DashboardPlugin`.
For more information, see the configurations described in the xref:{url_guides_config_hello}[configuration guide].
====

== Dashboard walkabout

Go to http://localhost:4005 to access the dashboard.

.Dashboard overview
image::guides/dashboard/dashboard.gif["Dashboard Plugin", 1000,align="center"]



=== Invoke command

The dashboard plugin allows you to invoke various commands via the *Invoke command* section.

The *Invoke command* section lists all the module based commands registered to a node. 

The command type is selected from the dropdown box.

As we registered the `DashboardPlugin` with the `hello_client`, it is possible to send a hello message via dashboard.

.Select "hello_createHello" command.
image::guides/dashboard/send_tx_dropdown.png["Transaction dropdown",750,align="center"]

Once the desired command type is selected, provide the `passphrase` of the sender account and the hello message.

The passphrase is retrieved from the file `passphrase.json`, which is located in the `config/default` directory of the blockchain client.

You can use the {url_gitHub_passphrase}[passphrase] of the `genesis` account of `hello_client`.

The hello message can be:

[source,json]
----
{
	"message": "Greetings from Lisk!"
}
----

Once all the necessary parameters are provided, click on the kbd:[Submit] button.

// NOTE: The accounts in your `accounts.json` file will be different, because the file was newly created before in the guide xref:{url_guides_genesisblock}[].

// .config/accounts.json
// [source,js]
// ----
// [
// 	{
// 		"passphrase": "wait yellow stage simple immune primary when digital bounce coin draft life",
// 		"address": "92ff111dfc904d1d8b077bf6e815fd21d881b005"
// 	},
// 	{
// 		"passphrase": "transfer alien ticket whisper face ability rally planet town brick profit solution",
// 		"address": "80bd220ff01b6a248822b337a11be79da7fb43d2"
// 	},
// 	{
// 		"passphrase": "broccoli coast fade over atom chimney skate symptom ten rug pave marble",
// 		"address": "252eeaf82f6d713501e561ddd437bf00a903f415"
// 	},

// 	// ...
// ]
// ----

.Enter information about hello message
image::guides/dashboard/send_tx_hello.png["Send transaction",750,align="center"]

If the transaction was successfully accepted, you will see the following confirmation:

.Send "createHello" transaction to node
image::guides/dashboard/send_tx_success.png["Transaction Sent successfully",1000,align="center"]

Once the transaction is confirmed and added on chain, it can be seen in the *Recent Transaction* section.

.Recent transactions
image::guides/dashboard/recent_transactions.png["Recent transactions",750,align="center"]

To verify that the hello message was sent successfully in the sender account, select the action `app:getAccount` from the section "Call action".

The action `app:getAccount` is part of the xref:{advanced_rpc_appactions}[application actions] and returns the account data for the account address that is specified in the action input.

Provide the address which is belonging to the passphrase that was used to create the hello transaction in the action input field, and click on the kbd:[Submit] button.

image::guides/dashboard/call_action.png["Invoke get account",400]

In the response, it can be seen that the hello message of the account was updated successfully.

image::guides/dashboard/call_action_success.png["Get account action success",400]

=== Subscribing to events

At the bottom of the dashboard is the *Recent events* window, which allows the possibility to subscribe to various events by selecting them from a dropdown box.

Select the `hello_newHello` event.

.Subscribe to newHello event
image::guides/dashboard/subscribe_event.jpg["Subscribe to newHello event", 1000,align="center"]

It is now possible to subscribe to the newly created event `hello_newHello`.

Once a new hello transaction is posted, the newHello event is also published subsequently and will show up in the *Recent events* window.

// image:guides/dashboard/receive_newHello_event.png[]

=== Invoking actions

Actions are invoked in the "Call action" section.

In the previous guides the following two new actions were created:

. The action `hello:amountOfHellos` of the xref:{url_guides_module_actions}[hello module]
. The action `latestHello:getLatestHello` of the xref:{url_guides_plugin_actions}[latest hello plugin]

==== Invoking `hello:amountOfHellos`

Select `hello:amountOfHellos` from the dropdown menu.

You can directly click on the kbd:[Submit] button to view the results.
It is not necessary to provide any input, because the action doesn't require any.

image::guides/dashboard/call_moduleaction.png["Invoke module action",400]

As two hello transactions were already sent, the action responds as shown in the illustration below:

image::guides/dashboard/call_moduleaction_success.png["Module action success",400]

==== Invoking `latestHello:getLatestHello`

Select `latestHello:getLatestHello` from the dropdown menu.

You can directly click on the kbd:[Submit] button to view the results.
Again, it is not necessary to provide any input, because the action doesn't require any.

image::guides/dashboard/call_pluginaction.png["Invoke plugin action",400]

As expected, the plugin responds with the latest hello message that was posted to the blockchain application.

image::guides/dashboard/call_pluginaction_success.png["Plugin action success",400]

The Dashboard plugin provides more features, and most of them are very self-explanatory.
For example, you can create new accounts, see all incoming transactions and forged blocks, or see general node and network information.
