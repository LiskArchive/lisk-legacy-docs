How to enable forging on a node for a particular delegate, and how to safely re-enable forging on another node.

== Adding the delegate info to the config

This step only needs to be performed when a delegate is enabling forging on a node for the first time.

To enable your node to forge for a particular delegate, firstly it is required to insert certain data into the config file under the `forging.delegates` array as described below:

* `address`: The address of the delegate.
* `encryptedPassphrase`: The symmetrically encrypted 12 word mnemonic passphrase of the delegate account.
* `hashOnion`: The onion of hashes that is used by the delegate.

Generate the necessary config object conveniently with the Lisk Core CLI.

The following command will return a config object to the console.
The object can be copy-pasted directly into the application configuration as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
lisk-core forging:config --pretty
----

The command will ask for the delegate passphrase, and in order to symmetrically encrypt the passphrase for the config, it will also ask for a password.

IMPORTANT: Store the password you used for the encryption somewhere safe.
It will be required everytime you wish to enable forging, in order to decrypt the delegates' passphrase in the config.

Add the JSON object to the config under `forging.delegates`.

`forging.delegates` stores the list of delegates who are allowed to forge on this node:

----

<1> Set the console log level to `info` to view all relevant logs on the console.
<2> Enable IPC to be able to use all commands of the Lisk Core CLI (see xref:{url_ref_cli}[])
<3> Add the delegate config info here, under `forging.delegates` of the node configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Restart the node to apply the changes in the config.
====

== Forger_info data

The `forger_info` data contains the following three properties:

* `height`: Last forged block height.
* `maxHeightPreviouslyForged`: Delegates largest previously forged height.
* `maxHeightPrevoted`: Delegates largest prevoted height for a block.

For each of these properties, the forger config contains the value used in the last block forged by the node.

These  three variables are required for enabling forging for the corresponding delegate.

== Checking the forging status

To check the forging status of a Lisk Core node, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
lisk-core forging:status
----

.Example output
----
[{"address":"89aa5fc8861d392f60662f76a379cc348fe97d28","forging":true,"height":670237,"maxHeightPrevoted":670159,"maxHeightPreviouslyForged":670187}]
----

The command returns a list of delegates, based on the list under `forging.delegates` in the Lisk Core config, (based on the details added to the config in the previous step, <<adding-the-delegate-info-to-the-config>>).
The following information is displayed for each delegate:

* The hexadecimal representation of the delegate address.
* If the delegate has forging enabled or not.
* The <<forger_info-data>>.

== Enable forging

[CAUTION]
====
. Ensure the node is **fully synchronized** with the network, before enabling forging on this node.
. If forging is enabled for a delegate for the **first time**, use `0` as the value for `HEIGHT`, `MAXHEIGHTPREVIOUSLYFORGED`, and `MAXHEIGHTPREVOTED`.
Afterwards, it is always required to use the latest values of the `forger_info` info data.
. To avoid being xref:{url_sdk_protocol_puninshment}[punished] by the network, ensure to adhere to the following points:
.. Never use outdated <<forger_info-data>>.
.. Never activate forging for the same delegate on two or more nodes at the same time, (a.k.a double-forging).
====

Enable forging with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
lisk-core forging:enable 9bd82e637d306533b1e1ad66e19ca0047faa1a6a --use-status-values #<1>
----

<1> Replace `9bd82e637d306533b1e1ad66e19ca0047faa1a6a` with the hex string representation of your delegate address, which was displayed while <<checking-the-forging-status>>.

This will automatically use the currently saved `forger_info` data to enable forging on the node.
Verify the correctness of the values `height`, `maxHeightPrevoted`, and `maxHeightPreviouslyForged` by answering `yes`, and use your password to decrypt the passphrase for forging.

WARNING: Don't trust <<forger_info-data>> from public APIs or explorers, make sure to always use your local data!
You can use your data automatically by setting the flag `--use-status-values`.

[source,bash]
----
 Current forging status for delegate account 331e287263c8166febde9d77a5f333df75056c74 is:

//TODO: Add examples/description/warnings on the --overwrite flag

== Disable forging

Sometimes it is necessary to disable forging, for example to update to the latest Lisk Core version, or if you are moving your node to a different server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you would like to completely stop forging without being punished by the network, make sure to unvote yourself, see:

* xref:{url_mgmt_accounts}[How to unvote via CLI]
* Alternatively, use {url_lisk_wallet}[Lisk Desktop^] to unvote.
====

Disable forging with the following command:

----
lisk-core forging:disable 9bd82e637d306533b1e1ad66e19ca0047faa1a6a #<1>
----

<1> Replace `9bd82e637d306533b1e1ad66e19ca0047faa1a6a` with the hexadecimal representation of your delegate address, which was displayed while <<checking-the-forging-status>>.

.Reference for the `forging:disable` command:
[source,bash]
----
Disable forging for the given delegate address.

USAGE
  $ lisk-core forging:disable ADDRESS

ARGUMENTS
  ADDRESS  Address of an account in a hexadecimal format.

OPTIONS

== Safely enabling forging on another node

To safely enable forging on another node, please ensure to follow the steps below:

. Setup a new node on another server.
. Start the node and let it synchronize with the network.
If available, it is recommended to synchronize from snapshots to speed up the synchronization process.
. Login to the server with the old node.
. <<forgingdisable,Disable forging>> on the old node.
. Stop the old node.
. Dump the data in the `forger_info` table of the db of your node.
+
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core forger-info:export
----
. Login to the server with the new node.
. Restore the `forger_info` table.
+
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core forger-info:import ./forger.db.tar.gz
----
. <<adding-the-delegate-info-to-the-config>>.
. Ensure the node is fully synchronized with the network.
The height of your node should be equal to the current network height.
+
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core node:info
----
. Fetch the forging data needed to enable forging by <<checking-the-forging-status>>.
. <<enable-forging>>.

== Safely enabling forging without forger_info data

Configurable Constants::

* `BLOCK_TIME = 10`: The block time of the considered blockchain in seconds, i.e., 10 for Lisk Mainnet.
* `MAX_FORK_DEPTH = 8640`: An upper boundary on the largest chain of off-chain blocks for which the validator generated a block, i.e., for every block at height `h` generated by the validator, the parent block at height `h - MAX_FORK_DEPTH` must be contained in the canonical chain that is eventually finalized.
It is recommended to use `MAX_FORK_DEPTH` = 8640 = 24*60 *6 (number of blocks generated in 24 h).

Required Delegate Input::

* `lastHeightActive`: Unix timestamp of the last height when the validator node could have possibly been active and forging, (over estimate with a larger number when uncertain about the exact time).

Instructions::
. Start a new node with forging deactivated and synchronize with the Lisk blockchain until there is a block `finalizedBlock` that is
finalized, and that the finalized block header timestamp is greater than the last active height: `finalizedBlock.header.timestamp > lastHeightActive`
. Obtain a block `parentBlock` which is a parent block of `finalizedBlock` at height `finalizedBlock.header.height - MAX_FORK_DEPTH`.

 parentBlock.header.height = finalizedBlock.header.height - MAX_FORK_DEPTH

. Compute the number of missed blocks in the current chain between the `finalizedBlock` and the `parentBlock`, i.e., as shown below:

 missedBlocks = ceil((finalizedBlock.header.timestamp - parentBlock.header.timestamp)/BLOCK_TIME) - (finalizedBlock.header.height - parentBlock.header.height)

. Use the following forging configuration and activate forging:

 height = finalizedBlock.header.height
 maxHeightPreviouslyForged = finalizedBlock.header.height + missedBlocks
 heightPrevoted = finalizedBlock.header.height
