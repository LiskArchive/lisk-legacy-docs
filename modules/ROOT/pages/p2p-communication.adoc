== Lisk Peer-to-Peer Communication

Peer-to-Peer communication serves a vital function within the Lisk
network. The peering mechanisms provide the required architecture to
facilitate network consensus, block propagation and transaction
propagation.

=== Architecture

The peers in the Lisk network use JSON objects with compressed
link:blocks.md[*blocks*] and link:transactions.md[*transactions*]. The
Lisk logic running on every node in the Lisk network uses remote
procedure calls (RPCs) and events to communicate the transaction and
block JSON objects to the other peers. The RPCs and events are also
transmitted as JSON objects with additional fields telling the Lisk
application which method to use in order to process the transmitted
object. In order to effectively transmit these JSON objects to the other
peers, websockets are used via the
https://socketcluster.io[SocketCluster Framework]. An overview of the
architecture of the peer-to-peer communication in Lisk is provided
below.

=== System Headers

Every time a Lisk node communicates with a peer of the Lisk network, a
system header is added to the message. The system headers are used to
identify full nodes and provide basic information about the software
running on the system.

The following JSON object is generated from system data for this
purpose:

  "os":"darwin16.3.0",
  "version":"0.6.0a",

  "minVersion":">=0.5.0"
}

=== Block Propagation

Block propagation serves a vital function on the Lisk network. Without
block propagation, the system would grind to a halt and the blockchain
would cease to function. Blocks are made in a decentralized fashion and
must be sent to all nodes on the network in order to establish
consensus. When a block is generated, it is broadcast to 25 randomly
selected peers. These forward the validated block to 25 randomly
selected peers and so on. In order to prevent overbroadcasting of data,
every block is given a relay limit of 3 and blocks that have already
been received are not broadcast again.

=== Transaction Propagation

Transactions must move from one node to all other nodes in order to be
included in blocks. The broadcast queue for transactions works by
drawing up to 25 transactions from the transactions pool and performing
a validation process on those transactions. These transactions are then
broadcast to other nodes in a bundled JSON object. This can be
represented as an array of objects, depending on the
link:transactions.md[*transaction type*]. The bundle is then broadcast
to the network at regular intervals, currently specified as every 5
seconds. The time delay allows the bundle to accumulate additional
transactions from the network (up to 25). In addition to broadcasting
the object, the bundle is given a relay limit to prevent spamming the
network. In the current implementation the relay limit is set as 3,
which means that every bundle will be broadcast for *at most 3 hops* by
the peers on the network.

=== Transaction Pool

The transaction pool provides the Lisk network a robust solution for
preserving unconfirmed transactions that have overflowed into the next
block. As described in link:blocks.md[*blocks*], each block can only
include 25 transactions and the transaction pool allows up to 1.000
multisignature transactions and other 1.000 for the remaining
transaction types to remain queued for the next block(s). The
transaction pool could be thought of as a memory pool, keeping
transactions ready until they are signed into a block. The second usage
of the transaction pool is to provide a mechanism for propagating
transactions. When a node prepares a transaction bundle, it draws up to
25 transactions from the pool and broadcast them to the network. In
order to keep the transaction pool tidy, all transactions are given a
time to live. This time to live is defined as 10800 seconds, or 1080
blocks. The final use for the transaction pool is to house transactions
with pending signatures. Like unconfirmed transactions, these
transactions will expire out of the pool based on the lifetime specified
when the transaction is first received.
