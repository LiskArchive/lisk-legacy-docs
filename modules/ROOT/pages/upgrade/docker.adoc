== Upgrade minor versions

To upgrade a Lisk installation using Docker Compose you simply need to export the new version number in `ENV_LISK_VERSION`.

Example: Upgrade from Lisk Core 2.0.0 to 2.1.1 by executing:

[source,bash]
----
export ENV_LISK_VERSION=2.1.1
docker-compose up -d
----

To upgrade the Lisk installation run `docker-compose up -d`.

== Upgrade major versions

For major version upgrades, there can be additional changes in `docker-compose.yml`.

In this case, Lisk Core provides an updated version of `docker-compose.yml` in the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core[Lisk Core repository] on Github, inside the `docker` folder: `https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core/tree/<CURRENT_VERSION>/docker`

(Where `<CURRENT_VERSION>` is the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core/tags[version tag] of the version you want to upgrade to.)

Use this file as a new template for your `docker-compose.yml`.

The rest of the upgrade process is analog to the <<_upgrade_minor_versions,minor version upgrade>>.
