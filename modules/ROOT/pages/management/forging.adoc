To enable your node to forge, firstly it is required to insert some encrypted data into the config file under the `chain.forging.delegates` array.
To encrypt your passphrase, it is recommended to use one of the following alternatives listed below:

* xref:{url_sdk_commander_commands}[Lisk Commander] via `encrypt passphrase` command.
* xref:{url_sdk_elements_crytpography}[Cryptography module of Lisk Elements]

The first alternative with the Lisk Commander is described in detail below.
Please ensure the Lisk Commander is installed in a secure environment.
Upon completion, please follow the commands listed below to generate the encrypted passphrase:

[source,bash]
----
$ lisk
lisk passphrase:encrypt --outputPublicKey
Please enter your secret passphrase: ***** <1>
Please re-enter your secret passphrase: *****
Please enter your password: *** <2>
Please re-enter your password: ***
{
        "encryptedPassphrase": "iterations=1000000&cipherText=30a3c8&iv=b0d7322bf24e0dfe08462f4f&salt=aa7e26c9f4317b61b4f45b5c6909f941&tag=a2e0eadaf1f11a10b342965bc3bafc68&version=1",
        "publicKey": "a4465fd76c16fcc458448076372abf1912cc5b150663a64dffefe550f96feadd"
}
----

<1> Enter the secret passphrase here that needs to be encrypted.
<2> Enter the password here that will be required to decrypt the passphrase again.

* Type in the passphrase followed by the password required for encryption.
* This will result in the creation of an `encryptedPassphrase` key-value pair.
* Create the JSON object and add it to the `config.json` under `chain.forging.delegates` as can be seen below:

<1> Contains options for the chain module.
<2> Contains forging options for delegates.
<3> Forces forging to be 'on'.
This is only used on local development networks.
<4> The list of delegates who are allowed to forge on this node.
To successfully enable forging for a delegate, the public key and the encrypted passphrase need to be deposited here as a JSON object.
<5> Contains options for the API module.
<6> Replace with the IP address which will be used to access the node

Reload the Lisk Core process to perform the changes in the config effective.
For example, for Binary install, execute the following command: `bash lisk.sh reload`

[[check_forging]]
== Check forging

Use the following `curl` command to verify the forging status of your delegate as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
curl \
  http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/node/status/forging \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json'
----

The result should appear as shown below in the following code snippet:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "meta": {},
  "data": [
    {
      "forging": true,
      "publicKey": "9bc945f92141d5e11e97274c275d127dc7656dda5c8fcbf1df7d44827a732664"
    }
  ],
  "links": {}
}
----

[[forging_enable_disable]]
== Enable/Disable forging

IMPORTANT: Remember that after restarting the Lisk node, it is necessary to re-enable forging again.

CAUTION: Do not activate forging for the same delegate on multiple nodes.
This behaviour will be punished by the network.
For more information, please see xref:{url_sdk_best_practices}[Lisk SDK - Best practices] page.

[TIP]
====
The endpoint to perform this action is *idempotent*.

This means that the results are identical, regardless of how many times the query is executed.
====

If your Lisk Node is running on a local machine, it is possible to enable forging through the API client, without any further interruption.

Use the following curl command to *enable the forging* for your delegate as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT \
  http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/node/status/forging \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
          "publicKey": "YYYYYYYYY",
          "password": "XXX",
          "forging": true
      }'
----

Use the following curl command to *disable the forging* for your delegate as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT \
  http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/node/status/forging \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
          "publicKey": "YYYYYYYYY",
          "password": "XXX",
          "forging": false
      }'
----

* `publicKey` is the key for the delegate which is required to be enabled/disabled.
* `password` is the password used to encrypt your passphrase in `config.json`
* `forging` is the boolean value to enable or disable the forging.
* The HTTP Port can be different based on your configuration, therefore it is recommended to check the `httpPort` in your `config.json`
