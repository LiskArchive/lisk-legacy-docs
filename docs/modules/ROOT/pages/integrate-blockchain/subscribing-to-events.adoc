By default, Lisk allows subscribing to xref:{url_understand_events}[a range of events] to retrieve on-chain data.

The emmited events can either be xref:{url_understand_rpc_events}[RPC Events] or xref:{url_understand_rpc_events}[Blockchain Events], however, regardless of their type both can be subscribed to in the same manner.

It is pertinant to mention that events usually emmit 

On this page, you'll learn about how the aforementioned events can be subscribed to within the Lisk ecosystem.

// Currently in the Lisk protocol, once a transaction has been included in a block, its effect is completely determined by the data inside of it. However, there are several cases in which this may not be the case anymore:

// The result of advanced transactions might depend on the state at the moment of execution, e.g. the conversion rate at which a swap in a DEX is executed, and cannot be read only from the transaction data.
// In the Lisk interoperability solution the effect of a cross-chain message that is part of a cross-chain update included in a block, does not necessarily depend only on its data: In some cases, the cross-chain message can be returned or its execution can fail.
// After the implementation of LIP 0055, transactions can fail, i.e. their execution can trigger an error but the transaction is still included in the block.
// Furthermore, some state transitions, like assigning the block reward to the block generator, are not induced by transactions but by the block header itself. In all these scenarios, the extra information about the execution of state transitions can be included in events, on-chain data emitted during the processing of a block. Front-end products can query the blockchain for the existence of a certain event and use the information contained to enrich the user experience.

// Events do not need to be explicitly included in the block (like, e.g., transactions), but can be rather authenticated collectively in the block header. This authentication mechanism can be used to ensure that a specific event has been emitted during the block processing, e.g. it can prove a cross-chain payment has been processed successfully.
