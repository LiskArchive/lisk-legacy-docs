The installation from source code is designed for anyone wishing to develop on the Lisk Core codebase.
It also comes with an extensive test-suite which is described in the `README.md`.
An installation performed from the source code enables a developer to work on the latest codebase of Lisk Core, which may not have been tagged for a release yet.

== Pre-Install

To complete the installation certain prerequisites need to be fulfilled.
If you have already performed these, then please proceed to the <<_installation, Installation>> chapter.

--
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libtool automake autoconf curl build-essential python2-minimal
----
--
MacOS::

=== Git

{url_git}[Git^] is used for cloning and updating Lisk as displayed below:

[tabs]
====
Ubuntu::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install git
----
--
MacOS::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
brew install git
----

====

=== Node.js

{url_nodejs}[Node.js^] serves as the underlying engine for code execution.

NOTE: The correct version for NPM v9 is installed automatically with version 18 of Node.js.

[tabs]
====
Option A - Node version manager::
+
--
It is recommended to use a Node version manager such as {url_nvm}[NVM^].
NVM is a bash script that enables the management of multiple active Node.js versions.

. Install NVM and follow the {url_nvm_instructions}[official instructions^] here.
. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js using NVM with the following command shown below:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install 18
----
--
Option B - Node.js package::
+
--
If NVM or other package managers are not required, it is possible to install the Node package globally  as shown in the following commands below:

*Ubuntu*

[source,bash]
----
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
----

*MacOS*

For MacOS, please execute the following command below:

[source,bash]
----
brew install node@18
----
--
====

=== PM2 (optional)

Install {url_pm2}[PM2^] for managing the start and stop of the application process in the background as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
npm install pm2 -g
----

== Installation

This section details how to install Lisk Core from Source code.
When completed, a functioning node on the Lisk network will exist.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core.git #<1>
cd lisk-core                                      #<2>
git checkout v3.1.0                               #<3>
npm install --global                              #<4>
----

<1> Clone the repository.
<2> Navigate into the lisk-core root folder.
<3> Check out the latest release tag.
<4> Install dependencies.

NOTE: Please check for the latest release in {url_core_releases}[core releases^].

To test that Lisk Core is built and configured correctly, execute the following command below to connect to the network:

[source,bash]
----
lisk-core start --network devnet

# From other terminal
lisk-core node:info
----

If the process is running correctly, no errors are thrown in the logs.
