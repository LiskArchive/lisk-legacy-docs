****
The Lisk SDK is an open-source software development kit that enables developers to build scalable xref:{url_blockchain_apps}[sidechain applications] in JavaScript & TypeScript.
****

// TODO: Update the page by uncommenting the hyperlinks once the updated pages are available. 

== Highlights

The most important highlights and features of the Lisk SDK:

* **One blockchain per app**: Each xref:{url_blockchain_apps}[sidechain application] runs on its own customized blockchain.
* Programming language: image:js-logo.png[JS logo, 32] **(JavaScript) & image:ts-logo.png[TS logo, 32] (TypeScript)**
* Consensus algorithm: *xref:{url_dpos}[Lisk DPoS] & xref:{url_bft}[Lisk BFT]*
* Completely modular: Configure, exchange, or extend any of the blockchain-related logic in the application with *xref:{url_introduction_modules}[] and xref:{url_introduction_plugins}[]*.
* *Convenient development tools*:
//** xref:{url_references_commander}[Lisk Commander]:
** Lisk Commander:
// *** xref:{url_guides_setup_bootstrapping}[Bootstrap] 
*** Bootstrap a complete, default blockchain application with a single command.
*** Generate skeletons for modules, assets, and plugins.
*** Use the Lisk SDK libraries directly in the terminal via the interactive Lisk console.
*** Many other convenient CLI tools such as creating accounts, encrypting passphrases/messages, and more.
// ** xref:{url_references_dashboard_plugin}[]:
Dashboard Plugin: Communicate conveniently with your blockchain application during development via a dashboard.
// ** xref:{url_references_test_suite}[SDK testing utilities]:
** SDK testing utilities: simplifies the testing of all components of a blockchain application by providing dedicated fixtures, mock-ups, and utility functions.
* *Interoperable*: Make your app interoperable with other blockchain applications, by registering it as a sidechain on the Lisk mainchain. For more information see xref:{url_interoperability_intro}[].




== Lisk SDK overview

.Lisk SDK ecosystem
image::diagram_sdk.png[Lisk SDK ecosystem diagram , 1000 ,align="center"]

As shown in the image above, Lisk Framework is built on top of Lisk Elements and uses a lot of its functions to complement its logic.
Developers can use Lisk Commander to generate a default blockchain application that is based on the Framework components, and add their specific business logic on top.

The Lisk SDK operates on the {nodejs}[Node.js^]. Its three components Lisk Framework, Lisk Elements, and Lisk Commander each provide specific utilities to blockchain developers, as described in the following section.

== Lisk SDK components

[width="100%",cols="23%,77%",options="header",]
|===
| Component | Description
| Lisk Framework | Lisk Framework is an application framework responsible for establishing and maintaining the interactions between the different components of a blockchain application.
// xref:{url_references_framework}[Lisk Framework] 

| Lisk Elements | Lisk Elements is a collection of libraries, each of which implements a certain type of blockchain application functionality such as cryptography, transactions, p2p, etc.
Each library of Lisk Elements is also published as an NPM package, and can be installed separately if needed.
For more information about Lisk Protocol, see {url_protocol_lips}[Lisk Improvement Proposals].
// xref:{url_references_elements}[Lisk Elements]

| Lisk Commander | Lisk Commander is a command line tool that provides various commands to simplify the development and management of blockchain applications.
For example, it allows the user to xref:{url_guides_setup}[bootstrap] a complete blockchain application with just one command.
