NVM is a bash script which enables the management of multiple active Node.js versions.

. To install nvm, please follow these https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installing-and-updating[instructions^].
. Install the **latest LTS** (Long Term Support), version of Node.js:

[source,bash]

Alternatively, instead of using the NVM or other package managers, the node package can be installed globally by executing the following commands listed below:

*Ubuntu*

[source,bash]
----
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

*MacOS*

Please install node@18.16.0 with brew. Now in order to complete the installation, execute the following command below:

[source,bash]
----
brew install node@18.16.0
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@18/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
