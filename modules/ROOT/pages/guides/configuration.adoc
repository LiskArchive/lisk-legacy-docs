[[modify_default_values]]
== Modify default values
If you wish to modify the default values, the following paragraph explains how to perform this, and also provides a devnet configuration example.
A devnet configuration can be thought of as a local network on your machine, whereby it is possible to safely experiment with the Lisk SDK.
The following configuration example shown here is a pre-configured default configuration to set up an instance.


NOTE: To view the pre-defined default configuration values, please see the xref:{url_reference_config}[list of configuration options].

=== Overwrite specific values

.Example of how to override the default config values:
[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, {
    app: {
        label: 'my-label' <2>
    },
    components: {
        logger: {
            consoleLogLevel: "info" <3>
        }
    }});
----

<1> Require the lisk-sdk package.
<2> How to override the default Label of the application.
<3> How to set the consoleLogLevel to `info`.

=== Use the devnet example config

TIP: Click here to view the {url_github_config_devnet}[configDevnet file on Github].

.Import the example config from lisk-sdk:
[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); <2>
----

<1> Require the lisk-sdk package.
<2> Passes the config json `configDevnet` as config object for the new application instance.
This will start the node with a fully functioning Devnet.

=== Overwrite the devnet example config

This can be used when the default behaviour for a local devnet is required to be changed. For example, if it is required for a block to be forged every 10 minutes instead of every 10 seconds (the default value), then this can be used to achieve this.
The configuration object `configDevnet` possesses the structure as shown in the xref:{url_reference_config}[list of configuration options].
It can be modified accordingly, before passing the config to the `Application` instance as shown below:

.Example how to override the example config object:
[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>

configDevnet.components.storage.database = 'my-custom-db' <2>
configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.public = true; <3>


const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);
----

<1> Require the lisk-sdk package.
<2> Example how to change the db name to my-custom-db.
<3> How to make the API accessible from everywhere.

[[config_options]]
== List of configuration options

In the above section we have just learned how to modify a configuration option. If you wish to know which other options can be modified, a complete list can be found here: xref:{url_reference_config}[All available configuration options of the Lisk SDK].

=== Constants

Inside `app.genesisConfig` specific constants for the blockchain application are set.

In the alpha version of the Lisk SDK, not all available constants are configurable by the user.
In future versions of the Lisk SDK, more constants will become configurable.

TIP: To see a full list of all constants and their predefined values, please see the file {url_github_constants_schema}.

[[genesis_block]]
== The genesis block

The genesis block describes the very first block in the blockchain.
It defines the initial state of the blockchain on start of the network.

The genesis block is not forged by a delegate, such as all of the other blocks which come after the genesis block.
Instead it is defined by the blockchain application developer, when creating the `Application` instance of the blockchain app, (see section <<modify_default_values,Modify default values>>).

TIP: Go to Github, to see the full file {url_github_genesis_block}[genesis_block_devnet.json]

A genesis block generator to create genesis blocks will be included in the Lisk SDK eventually.
For Lisk Alpha SDK, the exposed `genesisBlockDevnet` can be used as a template, and customized to your requirements.

It’s possible and recommended to customize the genesis block to suit the use case of your blockchain application.
The following template shown below describes all available options for the genesis block:
