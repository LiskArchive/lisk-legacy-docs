The binary installation offers an easy and automated approach to setting up Lisk Core.

== Pre-installation

=== Supported platforms
* Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) x86_64
* Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x86_64
* MacOS x86_64
* MacOS ARM (Apple Silicon)

== Installation

This section details how to install Lisk Core using pre-built application packages.
Once completed, you will have a functioning node on the Lisk Network.

When using a MAC powered by Apple Silicon, please adhere to the following setup instructions:

=== Environment setup requirements

As a first step, please ensure to clean the old Node.js installations (with arm64 binaries).

[source,bash]
----
rm -rf ~/.nvm
----

==== Install Rosetta (Intel x86 emulation layer)
Please execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
----

Add a new session and set the iTerm to open in the **Intel** mode. Now set a shortcut key (quick access), for opening the iTerm in the aforementioned mode.
Following that, open a terminal in Intel mode. Optionally, to verify that the terminal is now running in Intel mode, execute the following.

[source,bash]
----
$ arch
i386
----
// === Install Rosetta

==== Install Homebrew
Homebrew can be installed for either the ARM or Intel compatible binaries as mentioned below:
[tabs]
====

ARM compatible binaries::
+
--

[source,bash]
----
arch -arm64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
----

--

Intel compatible binaries::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
----
--
====
Add Homebrew to your `~/.zshrc` or `.zsh_profile`

[source,bash]
----
if [[ $(arch) = arm64 ]];
then
    echo 'Detected Apple Silicon, ARM Homebrew has precedence'
    export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
else
    echo 'Detected Intel CPU architecture, Intel Homebrew has precedence'
    export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
----
==== Install nvm
Node Version Manager can be installed for either the ARM or Intel compatible binaries as mentioned below:

[tabs]
====
ARM compatible binaries::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
arch -arm64 /bin/bash -c "wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash"
----
--
Intel compatible binaries::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash"
----
--
====
// When using the latest MAC hardware this allows mixing the Intel software with the native ARM compilations.

==== Install Node.js
To install Node.js please execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
arch -x86_64 nvm install 16
----
// TIP: For installing docker on M1 chips, check out the guide about {url_install_docker_mac}[installing Docker on a Mac^].
//TODO: Test if installing Python is necessary

==== Install Python (For Macs running on Apple Silicon)

To install Python on a Mac powered by Apple Silicon, execute the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 2.7.18
export PATH="$(pyenv root)/shims:${PATH}"
echo 'PATH=$(pyenv root)/shims:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
pyenv global 2.7.18
----

[NOTE]
====
Please note, that some minimal housekeeping is required to ensure the right paths are included in the profile.

* Apple Silicon (ARM) brew writes binaries to the following: `/opt/homebrew/bin`

* Intel brew binaries are stored (as usual), in the following location: `/usr/local/Homebrew/bin`

* Preference should be given to Apple Silicon binaries over Intel where possible.

Remember to export the nvm path, (this should be performed automatically by the script).

=== Download and execute the installation script

Download Lisk Core.

*Linux:*

[source,bash]
----
curl -o lisk-core.tar.gz https://downloads.lisk.com/lisk/mainnet/4.0.0/lisk-core-v4.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz
----

*MacOS:*

Unpack it, and add it to the system path, in order to use it in the terminal:

[source,bash]
----
tar -xf ./lisk-core.tar.gz
cd lisk-core
./bin/lisk-core
----

You can make the `lisk-core` command available in the PATH, e.g. by executing the following:

[tabs]
=====
bash::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/lisk-core/bin"
----

See {url_set_path}[^] for more information.

To make `lisk-core` permanently available in the CLI, add the above snippet to `~/.bashrc`.

To reload `.bashrc`, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
source ~/.bashrc
----

--
zshrc::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
export PATH="$HOME/lisk-core/bin:$PATH"
----

See {url_zsch_set_path}[^] for more information.

To make `lisk-core` permanently available in the CLI, add the above snippet to `~/.zshrc`.

To reload `.zshrc`, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
source ~/.zshrc
----

== Verify successful installation

To verify that your Lisk node is up and running, execute the following command:

[tabs]
====
Mainnet::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core start --network mainnet
----

[NOTE]
=====
The default log levels for Mainnet are:

[source,json]
----
"system": {
    "logLevel": "info",
},
----

When the node is started, the logs will be visible in the console.
You can adjust the level of logging as per your preference. Supported log levels are: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`.
To reduce the number of logs, it is recommended to set the log levels to `warn` or higher.

Alternatively, start the node with the following flag:

[source,bash]
----
lisk-core start --network mainnet --log=info
----

// See the xref:{url_run_logging}[logging] guide for more information about logging.
// TODO: Add link back, once the respective docs are updated
