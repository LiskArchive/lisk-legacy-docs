How to create a new blockchain application with the Lisk SDK.

[TIP]

====
To get started with the development of a blockchain application in the most simple and efficient manner, it is *recommended* to follow the guide <<bootstrapping-a-new-blockchain-application-with-lisk-commander>>.

If you prefer not to use Lisk Commander to get started with development, the <<manual-setup-alternative-without-lisk-commander>> is explained below.
====

== The Hello World application

In this guide and the following guides, it is explained step by step how to create a very simple blockchain which allows users to save hello messages in their accounts.

The following image provides an overview of the Hello application:

image:guides/hello-overview.png[]

To achieve this, complete the following steps:

. <<bootstrapping-a-new-blockchain-application-with-lisk-commander>>: The current guide is the first guide and explains how to bootstrap a default blockchain application.
. xref:{url_guide_module}[]: This guide explains how to create a new module and how to add it to the application.
In the example, the `HelloModule` will contain all on-chain logic related to the hello message.
. xref:{url_guide_asset}[]: This guide explains how to create a new asset and how to add it to a module.
In the example, the `HelloAsset` saves hello messages of users into their accounts, if they send a corresponding transaction.
. xref:{url_guide_plugin}[]: This guide explains how to create a new plugin and how to add it to the application.
In the example, the `HelloPlugin` will contain one action, which will return the latest hello message which was sent to the network, and its sender address.

==== Node.js

If you are using NVM, install the correct version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install v12.22.3
----

==== Lisk Commander

It is recommended to install Lisk Commander globally with NPM to facilitate the convenient usage of the Lisk Commander CLI.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --global lisk-commander
----

To check the successful installation of Lisk Commander, run the following command:

[source,bash]

$ lisk --version
lisk-commander/5.1.2 darwin-x64 node-v12.22.3
----

=== Initializing a new blockchain application

In this example, we want to create a new blockchain application with the name `hello_app`.

Therefore, create a dedicated folder `hello_app/`, which will contain the files for the application.

Inside of this folder, execute the `init` command of Lisk Commander as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir hello_app
cd hello_app
lisk init
----

The user is asked for the application name, description, author, and license after running `lisk init`.

Next, all the required files are created by Lisk Commander.

NOTE: The application CLI offers various commands to conveniently manage your blockchain application.

As shown in the snippet above, a new folder `src/commands/` will be created, which contains all files for the available command-line commands of the application.

=== Using the application CLI globally

To use the application commands globally, create an alias in the `.bashrc` file.

.~/.bashrc/
[source,bash]
----
alias hello_app="$HOME/hello_app/bin/run" # <1>
----

<1> Adjust to the path where your `hello_app` is located.

After updating the `.bashrc` file, make it directly available in the terminal by executing the following:

[source,bash]
----
. ~/.bashrc
----

Now it is possible to conveniently run these application CLI commands from anywhere by referring to the alias.

[source,bash]
----
hello_app --help
----

The above command will display the general xref:{url_references_cli}[CLI command reference]:

=== Starting the application

The blockchain application will have the following file structure after the first initialization:

----
.
├── bin/ <1>
│   ├── run
│   └── run.cmd
├── config/ <2>
│   └── default/
│       ├── config.json
│       └── genesis_block.json
├── jest.config.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json

│   ├── app/ <3>
│   │   ├── app.ts <4>
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   ├── modules/ <5>
│   │   ├── modules.ts <6>
│   │   ├── plugins/ <7>
│   │   └── plugins.ts <8>
│   └── commands/ <9>
└── test/ <10>
----

<1> `bin/`: Contains the script to run the CLI of the application.
<2> `config/`: Contains the configuration and the genesis block used by the application.
<3> `app/`: Contains the files of the blockchain application.
<4> `app.ts`: Creates the `Application` instance.
<5> `modules/`: Contains internal modules of the application.
This folder is empty after the first initialization with `lisk init`.
The command `lisk generate:module` creates new modules in this folder.
<6> `modules.ts` registers the modules with the application.
<7> `plugins/`: Contains internal plugins of the application.
This folder is empty after the first initialization with `lisk init`.
The command `lisk generate:plugin` creates new modules in this folder.
<8> `plugins.ts` registers the plugins with the application.
<9> `commands/`: Contains the logic for the CLI commands of the application.
The files for the different commands can be adjusted and extended as desired, for example, to include new flags and commands.
<10> `test/`: Contains the test files for unit, functional and integration tests.

These files create a ready-to-start blockchain application, configured for a local devnet, which uses only the default modules of the Lisk SDK.

The application is created in the file `app.ts`:

.src/app/app.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { Application, PartialApplicationConfig, utils } from 'lisk-sdk';
import { registerModules } from './modules';
import { registerPlugins } from './plugins';

export const getApplication = (
	genesisBlock: Record<string, unknown>,
	config: PartialApplicationConfig,
): Application => {
	const app = Application.defaultApplication(genesisBlock, config); // <1>

	registerModules(app); // <2>
	registerPlugins(app); // <3>

	return app;
};
----

<1> Creates blockchain application with the default modules.
<2> Will register additional modules to the application.
Currently, no additional modules are available for the application.
To add new modules update the `modules.ts` file.
<3> Will register additional plugins to the application.
Currently, no plugins are available for the application.
To add new plugins update the `plugins.ts` file.

To verify the successful bootstrap of the blockchain application, start it with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
hello_app start
----

The `start` command offers various options, allowing further configuration of the application.
For example, it is possible to define ports or to enable plugins that will be used by the application.
For a complete list of all available start options, visit the xref:{url_references_cli_start}[application CLI reference].

This should start the blockchain application, which is currently running with a local single-node development network.

Observe the displayed log messages in the console.
If no errors are thrown, the application will start to add new logs every 10 seconds after the initial startup.

Once it is verified that the application runs correctly, stop the node again with kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[C].

After the application was started for the first time, the corresponding application data can be found under the path `~/.lisk/hello_app/`

.~/.lisk/hello_app/

│   ├── forger.db
│   ├── genesis_block_compiled
│   └── node.db
├── logs  <4>
├── plugins <5>
└── tmp <6>
----

<1> `config.json` is the configuration file of the blockchain application.
<2> `genesis_block.json` is the genesis block of the blockchain application.
<3> `data` contains all on-chain data of the blockchain, stored in key-value stores.
<4> `logs` contains the file logs of the application and its' plugins.
<5> `plugins` contains all off-chain data of the application, stored in key-value-stores.
<6> `tmp` contains temporary application data.


==== How to reset the database of an application

Once the application is started for the first time, it will save the application-specific data under the path `~/.lisk/hello_app/`.

To reset the database of the application, simply delete the folder with the application data:

[source,bash]
----
rm -r ~/.lisk/hello_app/data/
----

=== Next steps

By installing Lisk Commander and running `lisk init`, a working blockchain application now exists with the default configurations for running in a local devnet.

To extend the application further, you need to register additional modules and/or plugins at the application.

For the next step, proceed with the guide xref:{url_guide_module}[].

== Manual Setup (alternative without Lisk Commander)

How to create a new blockchain application manually without using the Lisk Commander.

=== Dependencies

* Node.js v12 (latest)

If you are using NVM, install the correct version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install v12.22.3
----

=== Project setup

Create a new folder for the blockchain application and navigate into it.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir my_blockchain_app
cd my_blockchain_app
----

Create a `package.json` file.

[source,bash]
----
npm init --yes
----

Install the `lisk-sdk` package.

[source,bash]
----
npm i lisk-sdk
----

=== Creating a blockchain application

Create a new file `index.js`.
We want to use this file to store the code that will start the blockchain application by using the Lisk SDK.

In `index.js`, import the `Application`, `genesisBlockDevnet` and `configDevnet` from the the `lisk-sdk` package.

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk');
----

Now use the objects to create a blockchain application:

[source,js]
----
const app = Application.defaultApplication(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);
----

This will create a new blockchain application that uses `genesisBlockDevnet` as the genesis block for the blockchain, and `configDevnet`to configure the application with common default options to run a node in a development network.

[NOTE]
====
The `lisk-sdk` package contains the sample objects `genesisBlockDevnet` and `configDevnet` which enable the user to quickly spin up a development blockchain network.
`genesisBlockDevnet` includes a set of preconfigured genesis delegates, that will immediately start forging on a single node to stabilize the network.
`configDevnet` includes the configuration for the Devnet.

Both objects can be customized before passing them to the `Application` instance, if desired.

More information can be found in the guide xref:{url_guide_config}[].
====

Use `app.run()` to start the application:

[source,js]
----
app
	.run()
	.then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
	.catch(error => {
		console.error('Faced error in application', error);
		process.exit(1);
	});
----

After adding all of the above contents, save the file.
Now it is possible to start a blockchain application with a default configuration, that will connect to a local devnet.

=== Starting the application

Start the application as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js
----

To verify the application start, check the log messages in the terminal.
If the start was successful, the application will enable forging for all genesis delegates and will start to add new blocks to the blockchain every 10 seconds.

[NOTE]
====
After completing these steps, the default blockchain application of the Lisk SDK will now be running.

It is now possible to customize your application by registering new modules and plugins, and also adjusting the genesis block and config to suit your specific use case.
