== Overview

The advent of blockchain technology has resulted in a wide array of blockchain applications in a variety of different industry sectors worldwide.
Blockchain growth continues to march forward exponentially offering numerous innovative and limitless solutions.
However, this does not come without its challenges, as the many blockchains continue to grow and expand.
This in turn is coupled with the enormous growth in users and subsequently results in scalability issues, and transaction latency problems.

== What is blockchain scalability?

Scalability in this context can be defined as the platform or system's ability to manage and support an increasing amount or quantity of tasks, namely an increasing amount of transactions together with an increasing amount of nodes in the network.
Generally, blockchain networks suffer from low scalability.
In the blockchain world, this mostly refers to the transaction throughput, bootstrap time, latency, and even the cost of the actual transaction.
As is well known, the costs when executing crypto transactions can vary greatly with certain networks, however, from a high-level perspective these costs can be attributed to various factors, including the frequency and processing of large quantities of transactions.
A blockchain network can be classed as scalable when it is able to adequately handle a high volume of transactions per second (TPS), usually by the adjustment of certain system characteristics such as its consensus mechanism.

== Defining blockchain scalability

As growth in blockchain networks continues to increase exponentially, this naturally results in an ever-increasing number of nodes within the blockchain networks.
This in turn raises the issue of scalability.
Probably one of the best comparisons to make here to highlight the scalability issues would be to consider the number of transactions processed in the Bitcoin network, which currently runs to around 7 transactions per second.
If we compare this to the well-known Visa card processing system, the number of transactions processed every second is around 17,000.
To compound this further, issues with its practical applications and the difficulties when an increased number of users wish to use the network occur, as this causes the transaction process to slow down, and often increases the transaction costs, whilst restricting further users from joining the network.
There are various factors that define blockchain scalability, and generally speaking these consist of networking, capacity, and throughput.

As growth in blockchain networks continues to increase exponentially, this naturally results in an ever-increasing number of nodes within the blockchain networks.
This in turn raises the issue of scalability.
As the number of nodes increases, this subsequently results in an increase in transaction times, as it takes longer to process the transactions and reach consensus.
Hence, this causes degradation of the overall performance.
Probably one of the best comparisons to make here to highlight the scalability issues would be to consider the number of transactions processed in the Bitcoin network, which currently runs to around 7 transactions per second.
If we compare this to the well-known Visa card processing system, the number of transactions processed every second is around 17,000.

Various factors define blockchain scalability, and generally speaking these consist of networking, capacity, and throughput.
With regard to networking, every type of transaction that occurs is transmitted to all nodes residing in the network.
This can consume a vast amount of network resources coupled with increasing propagation delays.
Secondly, the capacity and cost also factor into this equation, as storing large quantities of data is a key requirement here.
Starting from the genesis block to the latest block and transactions consists of a large quantity of data, so it has to be taken into consideration that each network node does not possess adequate resources for the storage of such high volumes of data.

== Scalability bottlenecks

As mentioned above, in order to achieve scalability there are various challenges to be overcome.
To highlight these problems often regarded as bottlenecks, it is evident that the main issues consist of the following points:

* Block Size

This is one of the key issues with regard to scalability, as the block size significantly impacts the network capacity and speed.
There is a size limit for each block created which is known as the block limit.
As we have previously learned, blocks contain both actual data together with the transaction data.
For example, Bitcoin has a block limit of 1Mb.
The logic behind setting this limit was to prevent the miners from creating blocks that would be considered too large for other miners to accept.
However, limiting the block size results in reducing the transaction speed, as if a low limit is used then that transaction can be stored in the block, and subsequently will have to wait to generate a new block.
This in turn limits the speed of transactions being validated, hence slowing down the entire process in the blockchain network.
In addition, increasing the block size also has an impact, as this requires an increase in the node’s storage capacity.
Furthermore, if a node is required to upload a substantially large block into the network, this can cause delays in processing the transfer and could cause a loss of synchronization resulting in temporary chain splits.

* Response time

As in all blockchain networks, each transaction has to be validated as described on the xref:{url_how_blockchain_works}[How blockchain works] page.
Naturally, as the transaction volumes increase, this, in turn, increases the load on the network, and transactions are queued, which subsequently slows the process down.
This can easily result in very low TPS (transactions per second), rates.
In addition, this can also result in transaction fees increasing.
Effectively managing the load and transaction speeds are intertwined and are two of the key challenges to be overcome, hence why this metric is continually in the spotlight and developers are actively engaged in reducing the TPS.

* Limitations

As the blockchain grows and more and more transactions are processed, with increasing block sizes this is the crux of the issue, as there is an inherent danger of overloading the network, coupled with the existing hardware limitations being utilized by many of the nodes, whereby they are simply unable to handle the vast quantities of data and bandwidth requirements.

== Scalability trilemma

As the scalability issue is always at the forefront of efficiently managing blockchain networks, it is important to familiarize ourselves with the key issues here.
This can be characterized by referring to the blockchain network's ability to handle the continuing growth, ensuring the security is not compromised in any wave, shape, or form, whilst continuing to maintain the node synchronization, transparency, and fairness together in a fully functional decentralized network.
Ultimately, achieving this results in a trade-off, as depicted in the scalability trilemma diagram below.

image::intro/scalability-trilemma.png[,800 ,align="center"]

The scaling trilemma is classed as somewhat of a loose concept, implying that there is a trade-off between these three key components here, namely decentralization, security, and scalability.
Therefore, it is always a challenge to maximize the other two components without compromising the third, as can be seen in the following diagram below.
In this hypothetical example, if we were to improve scalability this requires compromising on decentralization and security.
However, it should be noted that as decentralization is a constant, a proportional relationship between scalability and security exists.
Hence, it is evident that a blockchain network is unable to optimize scalability, decentralization, and security simultaneously. As a result, we have to accept trade-offs.

== Increasing scalability - Solutions

Firstly before we delve into the on and off-chain solutions, another area to contemplate is to consider the vertical and horizontal scaling possibilities as depicted in the diagram below.
With regard to this methodology, simply put vertical scaling refers to adding further power to the machine.
Alternatively, horizontal scaling involves adding more resources to the existing network, effectively adding more nodes.
Generally, horizontal scaling is more advantageous as it is unlikely that any resource deficits will occur.

As scalability becomes more and more of a critical issue within the blockchain world, certain solutions exist that can be deployed to address this.
As more and more users enter the network this results in restricting and slowing down transactions.
There are various methods that can be used to address the scalability problem such as layer 1 and layer 2 solutions, scalable consensus methods, and DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph).

=== Layer 1 solutions - On-chain

Firstly, to improve the attributes and properties of the blockchain network Layer 1 solutions can be adapted to address such issues as reducing the block verification time or increasing the block size limit.
From a layer 1 perspective, other options consist of sharding and segregated witness (SEGWIT), as described below.

* Sharding

Sharding is relatively well known these days, and functions by creating ‘shards’ which are small manageable chunks of the network, which are the result of breaking down the blockchain network into smaller sections or chunks.
These chunks of the network are then executed in parallel with one another.
This in turn increases the network’s processing output, as each shard is responsible for handling a portion of the network's transaction processing tasks.
In essence, this is dividing the network into smaller parts increasing manageability.
The beauty of this is that to achieve faster and more efficient transaction throughput, there is no need to rely on the performance of individual nodes anymore.
Some of the blockchain projects currently deploying sharding are Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot, Zilliqa, Near, and Elrond.
Finally, more detailed information on sharding can be found xref:{url_sharding}[here].

* Segregated Witness

SEGWIT (Segregated Witness), is also a first layer option to increase blockchain scalability and is generally more prominent regarding Bitcoin and Litecoin.
In essence, it is an improvement enhancement that reduces the size of storing transactions in a block.
Basically, as the digital signature utilizes a high proportion of the total available space in a transaction, it reduces the size, resulting in increased storage space and capacity for transactions.

=== Layer 2 solutions - Off-chain
Off-chain scaling solutions have now become another option to solve the scalability issues resulting from various studies performed, which are not so heavily dependent on actual changes or modifications to the mainchain.
The crux of this is based on layer 2, whereby additional supplementary protocols are actually installed on top of the blockchain.
The role of these second layer protocols is to ‘offload’ transactions from the mainchain.
For example, these would consist of off-side chains and state channels.
The benefits here consist of reducing network congestion problems and also resolving storage issues.

* Side chains

A sidechain operates as a separate transactional chain alongside the mainchain and can be invaluable when large batch transactions are required to be processed, thus resulting in reducing the load.
Sidechains can also utilize different consensus techniques as compared to the mainchain.
In fact this approach is used by Lisk in order to improve scalability, as a Lisk sidechain can be adapted specifically for a blockchain app use-case.

* State Channels

With regard to off-chain transaction channels and blockchain networks, state channels offer the possibility to enable two-way communication between them.
Naturally, this results in substantially increasing the transaction speed as well as increasing the capacity.
State channels can be considered as resources that operate next to the mainchain, and are integrated using a multi-signature method or a smart contract.
The process works whereby when transactions are executed, the mainchain is able to record the end state of the actual channel, together with any other associated transactions.
Some of the blockchain projects currently using state channels are Raiden, Trinity, Perun, and the Lightning Network.
Finally, more detailed information on state channels can be found xref:{url_state_channels}[here].

* Lightning Network

The Lightning Network is also a well-known system for tackling scalability.
It is basically a transaction mechanism that can be utilized between users.
It functions by using an off-chain approach, whereby participants complete transactions to open and close channels.
This can be accomplished by using smart contracts via private off-chain channels over the mainchain.
In addition, the benefits include increasing the speed of the transactions, coupled with lower costs, mostly by moving the transactions away from the mainchain, whilst also reducing the load.

* Plasma

Plasma is another potential scalability solution, and functions by utilizing child chains that start with the parent blockchain.
This methodology works by having each separate child chain function as a separate blockchain.
As a result, Plasma can be highly beneficial whereby certain types of transactions are occurring, which may be required to deploy and execute specific use cases.
Plasma has proven abilities in assuring transaction execution is managed efficiently, and also has the added extra bonus of enhanced security.

Briefly, the Plasma structure is designed in a manner whereby it is built through the use of Merkle trees and smart contracts, enabling the creation of an unlimited number of child chains.
Each chain works singularly and ensures the different requirements are fulfilled by operating and coexisting independently.
Additional chains can be created on top of each child chain, resulting in a tree-like structure. As there are 4 main versions of the Plasma model, which results in different variants, the transaction process is not described in detail in this section, however, more detailed information can be found xref:{url_plasma}[here].

With regard to the Lisk sidechain solution, cross-chain update transactions are used to transmit the information/data between the chains.
By sending a cross-chain update, the receiving chain acquires the required information regarding the advancement of the sending chain.
Furthermore, the transaction can also include cross-chain messages and therefore this acts as an envelope for messages from one chain to another.

== Directed Acrylic Graph (DAG)

DAG is a unique methodology that is built on the concept of an intertwined network of parallel nodes and blocks, whereby each block contains a transaction with more than one parent root.
This type of structure has proven to scale well and has the added advantage of virtually no limits.
As the network grows and more transactions are performed, utilizing parallelization results in the network becoming both faster, coupled with a greater level of security.
From a consensus perspective, when contrasting DAG to other well-known mechanisms such as PoW or PoS, whereby the basis is having several users competing to add the next block, with DAG a profoundly different structure exists that enables them to function synchronically adding transactions almost simultaneously.

However, certain disadvantages and trade-offs exist when using DAG. It requires a high volume of traffic for it to function, and any decrease in traffic can increase the network’s vulnerability to attacks.
In addition, it is known to suffer from transaction propagation latency and an accumulation of unconfirmed transactions.
Nevertheless, Fantom, Byteball, and NANO are some of the major projects currently implementing DAG.
However, IOTA is probably the most commonly known DAG. Their DAG named Tangle, completely removes miners from the verification process, as in order to broadcast each transaction, two previous transactions have to be validated first before the transaction can be processed.
This in turn increases decentralization as it requires that all of the users have to reach consensus.

To summarise, DAG’s fundamentally new design concept has the ability to address the scalability issues specifically with regard to large networks that require the transfer of high volume data rates at speed without compromising security.

== Scalability in Lisk

Lisk is currently well-placed in this regard, firstly by its use of the DPoS consensus mechanism as explained in more detail on the xref:{url_blockchain}[What is blockchain] page.
Basically, DPoS is a very efficient consensus mechanism, whereby transaction validation is actually detached from the power required to run the nodes, therefore increasing the network scalability as compared to PoW.
In addition, DPoS does not demand vast power requirements either.
Furthermore, Lisk deploys deterministic block processing which in turn increases scalability further.
DPoS also possesses further key benefits of being a highly decentralized and efficient consensus mechanism, coupled with having fast transactions, faster node restart times, reduced block production times, and a high level of security, ensuring it is well placed for any Web3-based projects.
In addition, a limited amount of block processors are chosen by the voting delegates, resulting in making throughput much greater and faster.
Furthermore, with Lisk SDK v6 an additional consensus mechanism, Proof of Authority, (PoA) will also be supported, therefore the user will be able to choose between PoA and DPoS.
With PoA no consensus tokens are required, therefore it is possible to deploy a PoA sidechain that solely uses the Lisk token. This results in increasing the node's performance, resulting in a more simple and efficient system as it requires fewer message exchanges and less overhead.
Finally, resulting in an additional positive effect on scaling for the Lisk ecosystem.
Further information can be found here in the following Lisk blog post, xref:{url_lisk_poa}[PoA Consensus for Sidechains].

== Future of scalability in blockchain

To conclude this section, the ongoing quest continues to further enhance and improve scalability, which remains constantly in the spotlight.
Therefore it is predicted that achieving ultimate scalability on all fronts will require a combination of many different solutions.
Research and development towards new approaches are ongoing, and currently, constitutive scalability solutions are being studied, which do not require additional layers, whereby the immutability for all transactions is certified within the constitutive protocol itself.
At this stage, it is still at the research level, although it is inevitable that further improvements in blockchain scalability will come to fruition in the near future.
