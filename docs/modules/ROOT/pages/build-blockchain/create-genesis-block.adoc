How to generate a genesis block for a sidechain client.

.Prerequisites
[NOTE]
====
To use this guide, ensure the following criteria below have been fulfilled:

* A basic sidechain client is already initiated, as explained in the guide xref:{url_guides_setup}[].
* A custom module `HelloModule` is created, as explained in the previous guide xref:{url_guides_module}[].
====

Each client needs a xref:{url_genesis_block}[genesis block], which is the very first block of the blockchain.

During the init process of a sidechain client, the lisk-sdk bootstraps the first genesis block required for each sidechain and the relevant assets in the `config/default` directory of each client.

<1> The default configuration of the sidechain client exists in the `config.json` file.
<2> `dev-validators.json`: Contains the plain & encrypted keys, addresses, and other properties of 102 validators.
<3> `genesis_assets.json`: Contains details about the initial state of a sidechain such as account details for `token` and `pos` modules. It also contains the list of validators, etc.
<4> `genesis_block.blob`: A blob file of the genesis block.
<5> `passphrase.json`: Contains the passphrase used in various sidechain client operations.

== Why create a new genesis block?
For every new sidechain, a unique genesis block is required. 
As mentioned earlier, a default genesis block becomes available right after the client's `init` process. 
However, while running a public network, the developers have to create a new genesis block to change the initial state.
The initial genesis block is expected to be used only for development purposes.

To achieve this you can regenerate a genesis block for various use cases, such as assigning different tokens to specific addresses of your choice. 
Furthermore, it is also possible to recreate the genesis block based on the module's requirements, for example, setting up the initial constraints required for a staking module, etc.

NOTE: If a module wants to process a genesis block asset, the module needs to implement the `initGenesisState` or `finalizeGenesisState` hook available in each xref:{url_guides_module_skeleton} [Module Class]

== Using the CLI to generate a new genesis block

The genesis block can be re-generated with the application CLI.
By executing the following command in the root directory of the sidechain client, you can create a new genesis block.

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run genesis-block:create --output config/default --assets-file ./config/default/genesis_assets.json
----

The `--output` flag accepts the directory where you wish to create the `genesis_block.blob` file.

The `--assets-file` flag accepts the path where the `genesis_assets.json` file exists.
The asset's file can be tweaked as per the requirements and then based on the updated asset's file, a genesis block can be generated.

As a result of the `genesis-block:create` command, the new genesis block files will be created in the directory mentioned with the `--output` flag.

NOTE: For more information about the `genesis-block:create` command, check the xref:{url_references_cli_genesis}[CLI command reference].

After the genesis block creation is complete, the `passphrase.json` and `genesis_block.blob` re-generate under the `config/default/` directory.
