== Dependencies

The following dependencies must be installed in order to run applications created with the Lisk SDK:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|Node.js |10.15.3
|PostgreSQL |10+
|Redis (optional) |5+
|Python |2
|===

== Ports

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Mandatory:* Always open the *WebSocket* port of your desired network, to enable communication with other peer nodes.

*Optional:* Open the corresponding HTTP port for your network, to ensure your node’s https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/api[API] is reachable.
For more information, please see the diagram on the xref:{v_core}@lisk-core::{url-interact-with-network}[Interact with network] page.
====

To connect to the desired network with Lisk Core, please ensure that the corresponding ports are open:

[options="header",]
|===
|Network |HTTP |WebSocket
|Devnet |4000 |5000
|===

The ports can be xref:configuration.adoc[altered] later in the xref:configuration.adoc#_structure[`configuration`] file.

== Pre-Installation

=== Create a new user

[NOTE]
====
To install the required prerequisites, it is necessary to have a user with sudo rights on the server.
The `lisk` user itself *does not need* any `sudo` rights to run the node.
====

To run and manage a node in the future, please create a separate `lisk` user.
Please execute the following command:

[tabs]
=====
Ubuntu::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
sudo adduser lisk
----
--
MacOS::
+
--
It is not mandatory to set up a `lisk` user, especially when running a local instance for development purposes.
However, if it is required then it is recommended to create the user using the macOS GUI: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mtusr001/mac

=== Toolchain components
