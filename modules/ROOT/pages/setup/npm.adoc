=== Toolchain components

These are used for compiling dependencies.

[tabs]
====
Ubuntu::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libtool automake autoconf curl build-essential python2-minimal
----
--
MacOS::
+
--
Ensure that both {url_xcode}[XCode] and {url_homebrew}[Homebrew] are installed.

[source,bash]
----
brew install autoconf automake libtool python2
----
--
====

=== Node.js & NPM

{url_nodejs}[Node.js^] serves as the underlying engine for code execution.

//NOTE: The correct version for NPM(6) is installed automatically with version 12 of Node.js.

[tabs]
====
Option A - Node version manager::
+
--
It is recommended to use a Node version manager such as {url_nvm}[NVM^].
NVM is a bash script that enables the management of multiple active Node.js versions.

. Install NVM and follow the {url_nvm_instructions}[official instructions^] here.
. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js using NVM with the following command shown below:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install 18
----
--
Option B - Node.js package::
+
--
If NVM or other package managers are not required, it is possible to install the Node package globally  as shown in the following commands below:

*Ubuntu*

[source,bash]
----
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
----

*MacOS*

For MacOS, please execute the following command below:

[source,bash]
----
brew install node@18
----

[TIP]
=====
In case you experience any permission issues, please follow the instructions below to adjust the location of the global NPM packages:

. On the command line, in your home directory, create a directory for global installations:

 mkdir ~/.npm-global

. Configure npm to use the new directory path:

 npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'

. In your preferred text editor, open or create a `~/.profile` file and add the following line:

 export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH

. On the command line, update your system variables:

 source ~/.profile

More information can be found under {url_node_permission_errors}[^]

== Installation

Install the latest version of Lisk Core v3 with NPM:

[source,bash]
----
npm install --global lisk-core@^3
----

=== Location

Lisk Core will be installed under the installation path of NPM.

To check the location where Lisk Core was installed, execute the following:

[source,bash]
----
npm list --global --depth=0
----

== Start

After successful installation, start the node with the following command:

[tabs]
====
Mainnet::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core start --network mainnet
----

[NOTE]
=====
The default log levels for Mainnet are:

[source,json]
----
"logger": {
    "fileLogLevel": "error",
    "consoleLogLevel": "none"
},
----

So if you start the node, it won't show any logs in the console.
This is the recommended setting for reducing the number of logs for a running node.
However, to verify that the node started correctly, update the log levels in the config to `info` or lower.

Alternatively, start the node with the following flag:

[source,bash]
----
lisk-core start --network mainnet --console-log=info
----

See the xref:{url_run_logging}[] guide for more information about logging.

Testnet::

[source,bash]
----
lisk-core start --network testnet
