In this chapter, you'll learn how to create & customize a new xref:{url_intro_plugins}[plugin] for a blockchain client.

.Sample code
[NOTE]
====
View the complete sample code of this guide on GitHub in the {url_github_guides_plugin}[Lisk SDK examples repository^].
====

As defined in the xref:{url_build_index_hello}[Hello World application overview], the plugin shall provide the following functionality:

.Features of the Hello plugin
====
. The plugin should retrieve all events from the blockchain.
. The plugin should filter out the events generated by the `Hello` module.
. A plugin should accept a custom configuration based on which it should sync on-chain `newHello` events with the plugin's database.
. The plugin should store all `newHello` events in a database.
. The plugin should provide an endpoint to fetch hello messages, their sender addresses, and the height of the block where such an event was emitted.
====

.Prerequisites
[NOTE]
====
To use this guide, it is assumed that the following criteria have been met:

. Lisk Commander is installed, and a basic blockchain client is already initialized, as explained in the guide xref:{url_guides_setup}[].
. A new module `HelloModule` is created and contains all the functionalities as described in the guides for xref:{url_guides_module}[] 
====

== Generating the plugin's file & folder structure

While in the root folder of the Hello client, generate a skeleton for the new plugin with Lisk Commander.

The command `generate:plugin` expects the following argument:

* Plugin alias: The name of the plugin.
It needs to be a string that only consists of both lower case and upper case letters [a-z, A-Z].
No numbers, hyphens, etc., are allowed.

// TODO: Uncomment, once Commander reference is updated for v6.
//For a complete overview of all available options of the `generate:plugin` command, visit the xref:{url_references_commander_commands_plugin}[Lisk Commander command reference].

[[generate-plugin]]
[source,bash]
----
lisk generate:plugin helloInfo
----

This will generate the following files:

----
Using template "lisk-ts"
Generating plugin skeleton
Registering plugin...
identical .liskrc.json
   create src/app/plugins/hello_info/hello_info_plugin.ts
   create test/unit/plugins/hello_info/hello_info_plugin.spec.ts

No change to package.json was detected. No package manager install will be executed.


Finished creating plugin
----

The `hello_client` directory will update and will look like the following:

.hello/hello_client/src/app/
----
├── bin/
├── config/
├── src/
│    ├── app/
│    │    ├── app.ts
│    │    ├── index.ts
│    │    ├── modules/
│    │    ├── modules.ts
│    │    ├── plugins/ 
│    │    │   └──  hello_info/ <1>
│    │    │      └── hello_info_plugin.ts <2>
│    │    └── plugins.ts <3>
│    └── commands/
├── test/
│    ├── integration/
│    ├── network/
│    ├── unit/
│    │    ├── modules/
│    │    └── plugins/
│    │       └──  hello_info/
└──  └──            └── hello_info_plugin.spec.ts <4>
----

<1> The plugin's root folder `hello_info` is created under `src/app/plugins/`.
<2> `hello_info_plugin.ts` contains the bare-bone `HelloInfoPlugin` class.
<3> The `plugins.ts` file registers all the plugins with the `hello_client`.
<4> Contains the unit tests for the plugin.


After updating the directory, the Lisk Commander will also automatically register the plugin with the client by adding it to the `plugins.ts` file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once the first plugin is added to the application, a manual change in `plugins.ts` is required:

- Remove the underscore from the `_app` parameter and change it to `app`

Otherwise, you will run into the following error, when trying to start the client:

 reference error : app is not defined
====

.hello_client/src/app/plugins.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { Application } from 'lisk-sdk';
import { HelloInfoPlugin } from "./plugins/hello_info/hello_info_plugin";

export const registerPlugins = (app: Application): void => {

    app.registerPlugin(new HelloInfoPlugin());
};
----

== The "HelloInfoPlugin" class
The `HelloInfoPlugin` class is defined in the `hello_info_plugin.ts` file and it contains the plugin's skeleton along with default functions for a plugin.

.hello_client/src/app/plugins/hello_info/hello_info_plugin.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { BasePlugin } from 'lisk-sdk';

export class HelloInfoPlugin extends BasePlugin {
	public name: 'helloInfo';

	public get nodeModulePath(): string {
		return __filename;
	}

	public async load(): Promise<void> {
	}

	public async unload(): Promise<void> {}
}
----

Each plugin’s class must extend from the BasePlugin, which is imported from the `lisk-sdk` package.

NOTE: A plugin is highly customizable and can be implemented in any way as per the business needs. 
However, the only mandatory parts of a plugin are the `nodeModulePath()`, `load()` and `unload()` functions. 
Their efficacy is discussed in the xref:{url_plugin}[Plugin Anatomy] section.

It is worth mentioning that, our goal is to familiarize you with how to create and customize plugins in a blockchain client, our implementation of a plugin can undoubtedly differ from yours depending on your business logic.

Now that we have the bare-bone structure for our `HelloInfoPlugin`, let's customize it.
