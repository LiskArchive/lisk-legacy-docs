:v_core: master

A simple application which rewards its users for sending tokens.
The cashback reward tokens are minted newly and increase the absolute amount of tokens in the network.

The Cashback App implementation goes as following:

* *Steps 1-5* describe the node-side implementation of the blockchain application.
* *Step 6* shows how to interact with the network from the (blockchain) client-side using a node script.
* *Step 7* explains how to override specific config values.

TIP: Check out the *full code example* of the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/tree/development/cashback[Cashback App on Github].

== 1. Set up Lisk SDK

First, let’s create the root folder for the Cashback App and initialize the project:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir cashback <1>
cd cashback <2>
npm init --yes <3>
----

<1> create the root folder for the blockchain application
<2> navigate into the root folder
<3> initialize the manifest file of the project

As next step, we want to install the `lisk-sdk` package and add it to our projects’ dependencies.

=== Supported Platforms

* Ubuntu 16.04 (LTS) x86_64
* Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) x86_64
* MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)
* MacOS 10.14 (Mojave)

=== Dependencies

[options="header"]
|===
|Dependencies |Version

|Node.js |10.15.3

|PostgreSQL |10+

|Redis (optional) |5+

|Python |2
|===

IMPORTANT: If you miss some of the dependencies, please go to xref:setup.adoc#_pre_installation[Lisk SDK - Pre-Install] and follow the pre-installation steps for the SDK.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --save lisk-sdk <1>
npm install --save @liskhq/lisk-validator @liskhq/lisk-cryptography @liskhq/lisk-transactions @liskhq/lisk-constants <2>
----

<1> install lisk-sdk as dependency for the node server side
<2> install lisk-elements dependencies for the client side scripts

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you haven’t already, you need to create a database before you start.
The default database name is lisk_dev, so for the development purposes, a command createdb lisk_dev will set you up.
The default database user and password are lisk and password, they can be both changed in the configuration of Lisk SDK.
====

Make sure to start with a fresh database.

[tabs]
====
Postgres system-wide::
+
--
For the *system-wide Postgres* installation:

[source,bash]
----
psql -c "DROP DATABASE lisk_dev"
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE lisk_dev OWNER lisk"
----
--
Postgres with Docker::
+
--
If you have installed xref:setup.adoc#_option_a_postgres_with_docker[Postgres with Docker], you need to run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -ti lisk_sdk_db psql -h localhost -U lisk -d postgres -c "DROP DATABASE lisk_dev"
docker exec -ti lisk_sdk_db psql -h localhost -U lisk -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE lisk_dev OWNER lisk"
----
--
====

Create the file `index.js`, which will hold the logic to initialize and start the blockchain application.

== 2. Configure the application

Next, let’s configure the application, to provide basic information about the application we are going to build.

To do this, open the file `index.js` that was created with the step before, and insert the following code:

.Contents of index.js
[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>

configDevnet.app.label = 'cashback-blockchain-app'; <2>
//configDevnet.components.storage.user = '<username>'; <3>
// configDevnet.components.storage.password = 'password'; <4>

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); <5>

app <6>
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
----

NOTE: See the complete file on Github: https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/tree/development/cashback/index.js[cashback/index.js].

<1> Require application class, the default genesis block and the default config for the application.
We require the needed dependencies from the `lisk-sdk` package.
The most important one is the `Application` class, which is used in <5> to create the application instance.
The application instance will start the whole application at the bottom of `index.js`.
<2> Set the name of your blockchain application.
<3> In case you gave a different user than 'lisk' access to the database `lisk_dev`, you need to update the username in the config.
<4> Uncomment this and replace `password` with the password for your database user.
<5> The application instance is created.
By passing the parameters for the xref:configuration.adoc#_the_genesis_block[genesis block] and the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk/blob/development/sdk/src/samples/config_devnet.json[configuration template], the application is configured with the most basic configurations to start the network.
<6> The code block below starts the application and doesn't need to be changed.

TIP: If you want to change any of the values for `configDevnet`, check out the xref:configuration.adoc#_list_of_configuration_options[full list of configurations] for Lisk SDK and overwrite them like described in <<_7_customize_the_default_configuration,step 7>>

After adding the code block above, you can save and close `index.js`.
At this point, you already can start the node and the network, to verify that the setup was successful:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short
----

`node index.js` will start the node, and `| npx bunyan -o short` will pretty-print the logs in the console.

If everything is ok, the following logs will be displayed:

....

== 3. Create a new transaction type

Now, we want to create a new xref:customize.md[custom transaction type] `CashbackTransaction`:
It extends the pre-existing transaction type `TransferTransaction`.
The difference between the regular `TransferTransaction` and the `CashbackTransaction`, is that Cashback transaction type also pays out a 10% bonus reward to its sender.

So e.g. if Alice sends 100 token to Bob as a Cashback transaction, Bob would receive the 100 token and Alice would receive additional 10 tokens as a cashback.

image:cashback_diagram.png[Business logic of a cashback transaction]

[NOTE]
====
If you compare the methods below with the methods we implemented in the `HelloTransaction`, you will notice, that we implement fewer methods for the `CashbackTransaction`.
This is because we extend the `CashbackTransaction` from an already existing transaction type `TransferTransaction`.
As a result, all required methods are implemented already inside the `TransferTransaction` class, and we only need to overwrite/extend explicitely the methods we want to customize.
====

[WARNING]
====
*General advise:* Be aware, if you extend your custom trasnaction type from already existing Transaction types, your logic might by affected by future changes in the codebase of the transaction type you extend from.
Therefore, keep an eye on future changes for the transaction types you depend on, or just use the xref:customize.adoc[BaseTransaction] as basis for your transaction type.
====

Now, let’s create a new file `cashback_transaction.js` which is defines the new transaction type `CashbackTransaction`:

[source,bash]
----
touch cashback_transaction.js
----

To do this, open the file `cashback_transaction.js` that was created with the command above, and insert the following code:

.Contents of cashback_transaction.js
[source,js]
----
const {
    transactions: { TransferTransaction },
    BigNum,
} = require('lisk-sdk');

class CashbackTransaction extends TransferTransaction {

    /**
    * Set the Cashback transaction TYPE to `11`.
    * The first 10 types, from `0-9` is reserved for the default Lisk Network functions.
    * Type `10` was used previously for the `HelloTransaction`, so we set it to `11`, but any other integer value (that is not already used by another transaction type) is a valid value.
    */
    static get TYPE () {
        return 11;
    }

    /**
    * Set the `CashbackTransaction` transaction FEE to 0.1 LSK.
    * Every time a user posts a transaction to the network, the transaction fee is paid to the delegate who includes the transaction into a block that the delegate forges.
    */
    static get FEE () {
        return `${10 ** 7}`;
    };

    /**
    * The CashbackTransaction adds an inflationary 10% to senders account.
    * Invoked as part of the apply() step of the BaseTransaction and block processing.
    */
    applyAsset(store) {
        super.applyAsset(store);

        const sender = store.account.get(this.senderId);
        const updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus = new BigNum(sender.balance).add(
            new BigNum(this.amount).div(10)
        );
        const updatedSender = {
            ...sender,
            balance: updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus.toString(),
        };
        store.account.set(sender.address, updatedSender);

        return [];
    }

    /**
    * Inverse of applyAsset().
    * Undoes the changes made in `applyAsset` step: It sends the transaction amount back to the sender and substracts 10% of the transaction amount from the senders account balance.
    */
    undoAsset(store) {
        super.undoAsset(store);

        const sender = store.account.get(this.senderId);
        const updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus = new BigNum(sender.balance).sub(
            new BigNum(this.amount).div(10)
        );
        const updatedSender = {
            ...sender,
            balance: updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus.toString(),
        };
        store.account.set(sender.address, updatedSender);

        return [];
    }
}

module.exports = CashbackTransaction;
----

TIP: See the file on Github: https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/cashback/cashback_transaction.js[cashback/cashback_transaction.js]

After adding the code block above, save and close `cashback_transaction.js`.

== 4. Register the new transaction type

Right now, your project should have the following file structure:

....
cashback
├── cashback_transaction.js
├── index.js
├── node_modules
└──package.json
....

Add the new transaction type to your application, by registering it to the application instance inside of `index.js`.

NOTE: You only need to add 2 new lines (number <2> and <7>) to your existing `index.js`, to register the new transaction type.

.Contents of index.js
[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>
const CashbackTransaction = require('./cashback_transaction'); <2>

configDevnet.app.label = 'cashback-blockchain-app'; <3>
//configDevnet.components.storage.user = '<username>'; <4>
configDevnet.components.storage.password = 'password'; <5>

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); <6>

app.registerTransaction(CashbackTransaction); <7>

app <8>
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
----

TIP: See the file on Github: https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/tree/development/cashback/index.js[cashback/index.js].

<1> Require application class, the default genesis block and the default config for the application
<2> *New line*: Require the newly created transaction type 'CashbackTransaction'
<3> Change the label of the app
<4> If you gave a different user than 'lisk' access to the database lisk_dev, you need to update the username in the config
<5> Replace password with the password for your database user
<6> Create the application instance
<7> *New line*: Register the 'CashbackTransaction'
<8> The code block below starts the application and doesn't need to be changed

After adding the 2 new lines to your `index.js` file, save and close it.

== 5. Start the network

Now, let’s start our customized blockchain network for the first time.

The parameter `configDevnet`, which we pass to our `Application` instance in step 3, is preconfigured to start the node with a set of dummy delegates, that have enabled forging by default.

These dummy delegates stabilize the new network and make it possible to test out the basic functionality of the network with only one node immediately.

This creates a simple Devnet, which is beneficial during development of the blockchain application.

[NOTE]
====
The dummy delegates can be replaced with real delegates later on.
For this, users needs to create new secret accounts, and register themselves as delegates on the network.
Then the account(s) with most tokens need to unvote the dummy delegates, and vote for the newly registered delegates instead.
====

To start the network, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short
----

Check the logs to verify the network has started successfully.

If an error occurs the process should stop, and the error with debug information will be displayed.

== 6. Interact with the network

Now that your network is running, let’s try to send a `CashbackTransaction` to our node to see if it gets accepted.

[NOTE]
====
As your blockchain process is running in your current console window, you need to open a new window to proceed with the tutorial.
Make sure to navigate into the root folder of your blockchain application in the new console window.
====

In the new terminal window, create the transaction object.

[source,bash]
----
cd hello-world <1>
mkdir client <2>
cd client <3>
touch print_sendable_cashback.js <4>
----

<1> make sure to be in the root folder of the Cashback application.
<2> create the folder for the client-side scripts inside the cashback folder
<3> navigate into the client folder
<4> create the file that will hold the code to create the transaction object

Open the file `print_sendable_cashback.js` that was created with the command above, and insert the following code:

.Content of client/print_sendable_cashback.js
[source,js]
----
const CashbackTransaction = require('../cashback_transaction');
const transactions = require('@liskhq/lisk-transactions');
const { EPOCH_TIME } = require('@liskhq/lisk-constants');

const getTimestamp = () => {
    // check config file or curl localhost:4000/api/node/constants to verify your epoc time
    const millisSinceEpoc = Date.now() - Date.parse(EPOCH_TIME);
    const inSeconds = ((millisSinceEpoc) / 1000).toFixed(0);
    return  parseInt(inSeconds);
};

const tx = new CashbackTransaction({
    amount: `${transactions.utils.convertLSKToBeddows('2')}`,
    fee: `${transactions.utils.convertLSKToBeddows('0.1')}`,
    recipientId: '10881167371402274308L', //delegate genesis_100
    timestamp: getTimestamp(),
});

tx.sign('wagon stock borrow episode laundry kitten salute link globe zero feed marble');

console.log(tx.stringify());
process.exit(0);
----

TIP: See the complete file on Github: https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/cashback/client/print_sendable_cashback.js[cashback/client/print_sendable_cashback.js].

This script will print the transaction in the console, when executed.

NOTE: Python’s `json.tool` is used to prettify the output

[source,bash]
----
node print_sendable_cashback.js | python -m json.tool
----

The generated transaction object should look like this:

.Signed Transaction object
[source,json]
----
{
   "id":"5372254888441494149",
   "amount":"200000000",
   "type":11,
   "timestamp":3,
   "senderPublicKey":"c094ebee7ec0c50ebee32918655e089f6e1a604b83bcaa760293c61e0f18ab6f",
   "senderId":"16313739661670634666L",
   "recipientId":"10881167371402274308L",
   "fee":"10000000",
   "signature":"0a3f41cc529f9de523cadc7db64e9436014d1b10ca2158bbce0469e8e76dfd021358496440da43acaf64d0223d3514609fc1aa41646be56353207d88a03b1305",
   "signatures":[],
   "asset":{}
}
----

Now that we have a sendable transaction object, let’s send it to our node and see how it gets processed by analyzing the logs.

For this, we utilize the HTTP API of the node and post the created transaction object to the transaction endpoint of the API.

Before posting the transaction, let’s check the balances of sender and recipient, to verify later that the transaction was applied correctly:

IMPORTANT: Make sure your node is running, before sending API requests to it.

To check the account balance of the sender:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/accounts?address=16313739661670634666L" -H "accept: application/json" | python -m json.tool
----

.Response from api/accounts endpoint with initial balance of the sender
[source,json]
----
{
  "meta": {
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 10
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "address": "16313739661670634666L",
      "publicKey": "c094ebee7ec0c50ebee32918655e089f6e1a604b83bcaa760293c61e0f18ab6f",
      "balance": "10000000000000000",
      "secondPublicKey": ""
    }
  ],
  "links": {}
}
----

Checking the account balance of the recipient:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/accounts?address=10881167371402274308L" -H "accept: application/json" | python -m json.tool
----

[NOTE]
====
You might notice, the account data of `10881167371402274308L` contains more info than the account data of `16313739661670634666L`.
This is simply because `10881167371402274308L` is a registered delegate, so additional information like the delegates name and the vote weight are stored in the accounts database entry.
====

.Response from api/accounts endpoint with initial balance of the recipient

----

Because the API of every node is only accessible from localhost by default, you need to execute this query on the same server that your node is running on, unless you changed the config to <<_7_customize_the_default_configuration,make your API accessible>> to others or to the public.

IMPORTANT: Make sure your node is running, before sending the transaction

.POST the transaction the local node
[source,bash]
----
node print_sendable_cashback.js | tee >(curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- localhost:4000/api/transactions) <1>
----

<1> posts the tx object to the node and displays it on the console

If the node accepted the transaction, it should respond with:

....
{"meta":{"status":true},"data":{"message":"Transaction(s) accepted"},"links":{}}
....

To verify that the transaction was included in a block:

NOTE: Use as `id` the id of your transaction object, that is posted to the node in the previous step

****
In this example, the sender was sending 2 LSK to the recipient, and paid a transaction fee of 0.1 LSK. +
At the same time, the sender gets a cashback of 10% of the transaction amount: 2 LSK * 10% = 0.2 LSK.

As a result, the recipient should get a credit of 2 LSK, and *the sender s’ balance should be reduced by 1.9 LSK* +
(-2 LSK, plus a credit of 0.1 LSK [= 0.2 LSK (cashback) - 0.1 LSK (tx fee)] = -1.9 LSK).
****

NOTE: Note, that the balance of an account is stored in Beddows. 1 LSK = 100000000(= 10^8) Beddows.

Verify, that the sender account balance is reduced by 1.9 LSK:

If the balances equal the expected values, it is verified the new custom transaction type `CashbackTransaction` is successfully integrated into the application.

For further interaction with the network, it is possible to run the process in the background by executing:

[source,bash]
----
cd cashback <1>
pm2 start --name cashback index.js <2>
pm2 stop cashback <3>
pm2 start cashback <4>
----

<1> navigate into the root folder of the Cashback application.
<2> add the application to pm2 under the name 'cashback'
<3> stop the cashback app
<4> start the cashback app

[NOTE]
====
PM2 needs to be installed on the system in order to run these commands.
See xref:setup.adoc#_pre_installation[SDK Pre-Install section].
====

== 7. Customize the default configuration

Your project should have now the following file structure:

....
cashback
├── client
│   └── print_sendable_cashback.js
├── cashback_transaction.js
├── index.js
├── node_modules
└── package.json
....

To run the script from remote, change the configuration before creating the `Application` instance, to make the API accessible:

TIP: For more configuration options, check out the xref:configuration.adoc#_list_of_configuration_options[full list of configurations] for Lisk SDK

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>
const CashbackTransaction = require('./cashback_transaction'); <2>

configDevnet.app.label = 'cashback-blockchain-app'; <3>
//configDevnet.components.storage.user = '<username>'; <4>
//configDevnet.components.storage.password = 'password'; <5>

configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.public = true; <6>
//configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.whitelist.push('1.2.3.4'); <7>

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); <8>

app.registerTransaction(CashbackTransaction); <9>

app <10>
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
----

<1> Require application class, the default genesis block and the default config for the application
<2> Require the newly created transaction type 'CashbackTransaction'
<3> Set the name of your blockchain application
<4> In case you gave a different user than 'lisk' access to the database lisk_dev, you need to update the username in the config
<5> Uncomment this and replace `password` with the password for your database user
<6> Make the API accessible from everywhere
<7> Example how to make the API accessible for specific IP addresses: add 1.2.3.4 IP address as whitelisted
<8> Create the application instance
<9> Register the 'CashbackTransaction'
<10> The code block below starts the application and doesn't need to be changed

[NOTE]
====
*Optional:* After first successful verification, you may want to reduce the default console log level (info) and file log level (debug).
You can do so, by passing a copy of the config object `configDevnet` with customized config for the logger component:

[source,js]
----
configDevnet.components.logger.fileLogLevel = "error"; <1>
configDevnet.components.logger.consoleLogLevel = "none"; <2>
----

<1> will only log errors and fatal errors in the log file
<2> no logs will be shown in console
====

As next step, you can use a wallet software like e.g. a customized https://lisk.io/hub[Lisk Hub], so that users can utlize the new transaction type.
