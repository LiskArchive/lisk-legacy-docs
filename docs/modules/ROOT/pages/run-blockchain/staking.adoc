====
On this page, you'll learn how to (un-)stake tokens for a validator.

This includes how to:

* [x] Stake tokens
* [x] Un-stake tokens
* [x] Unlock tokens after un-stake
====

== Introduction
Any accounts with sufficient tokens can stake them to increase the <<validator-weight>> of one or multiple validators.

[#locked-tokens]
*Staked tokens are locked* inside the account that is performing the staking.
That means, the tokens used for staking stay in the account of the staker, but while they are used for staking, they cannot be used for any other purposes like for example token transfers.
The staked tokens can be un-staked partially or completely again, if the account owner wishes to unlock the tokens.

[#self-stake]
Staking is particulary important for validators, because they need to stake a significant amount of their own tokens for their validator account.
This is also calld *self-staking*.

But accounts can have incentives to stake their tokens for a different validator as well:
First, it is a great way to support the most trustful and helpful validators in the community, which increases the decentralization and security of the network.
Second, a lot of validators are rewarding stakers with a share of their block rewards, creating a financial incentive for users to stake their unused tokens and receive regular payout as reward.

There are various different services and tools to stake tokens, for example: {url_lisk_wallet}[Lisk Desktop^], xref:{url_sdk_elements}[Lisk Elements], the node CLI or the Dashboard plugin.
// TODO: Add link to dashboard plugin how-to guide, once it is updated for v6
// There are many possibilities to create the transaction, for example: {url_lisk_wallet}[Lisk Desktop^], xref:{url_elements}[Lisk Elements], or the xref:{url_framework_dashbobardplugin}[].

In the following examples, the node CLI is used to create and send the respective Stake transaction.

=== Validator weight

Every validator has an associated *validator weight*.
A high validator weight will put a validator in an active position to generate new blocks for the blockchain.

IMPORTANT: The *minimum validator weight required* to be selected as a block generator is 1000 LSK in the Lisk Mainnet.

Formally, the validator weight is defined as the following:

----
validatorWeight = minimum { 10 * selfStake , totalStakeReceived },
----

* `selfStake` is the amount of tokens the validator staked for themselves, and
* `totalStakeReceived` is the sum of all staked tokens (including self-stakes) for a specific validator.

NOTE: This definition implies that *at least 10% of the validator weight always consist of self-stakes*.

== Start the blockchain application

If it is not already running,  start the node, to conveniently create and send a transaction.

== (Un-)Staking

Create a transaction to stake or un-stake tokens for one or multiple validators.

NOTE: Up to 20 stakes and/or un-stakes can be included in a single Stake transaction.

The following parameter is required:

* `stakes`: An array items with the following two properties:
** `amount`: Amount of tokens to (un-)stake.
** `validatorAddress`: The address of the validator to (un-)stake the tokens to.

TIP: A *positive* `amount` of tokens indicates a *stake*, whereas a *negative* `amount` of tokens indicates an *un-stake*.

== Unlocking tokens after un-stake

In case you un-staked tokens from one or multiple validators and wish to be able to freely use the tokens for other purposes than staking, it is required to unlock the tokens.

The Unlock transaction will unlock all tokens which are *pending*, i.e. currently locked in the account, without being used for staking.

=== Checking for pending tokens ready to be unlocked

If you wish to check the amount of tokens that are ready to be unlocked in an account, query the `pos_getPendingUnlocks` RPC endpoint:

Lisk Core::

--
//TODO: Verify Lisk Core command

----
./bin/run endpoint:invoke pos_getPendingUnlocks '{ "address":"lskqaxxmj78frvgpjgwvf4yqjjkcrr9yhn2sxxwm3"}' --pretty
----

=====

This will return the total amount of pending tokens:

[source,json]

{
  "pendingUnlocks": [
    {
      "validatorAddress": "lskqaxxmj78frvgpjgwvf4yqjjkcrr9yhn2sxxwm3",
      "amount": "1000000000",
      "unstakeHeight": 348,
      "unlockable": false,
      "expectedUnlockableHeight": 26348
    }
  ]
}
-----

* `validatorAddress`: The address of the validator from whom the tokens got unstaked.
* `amount`: Amount of unstaked tokens.
* `unstakeHeight`: Height of the unstake.
* `unlockable`: `true` if tokens can be unlocked, `false` if not.
* `expectedUnlockableHeight`: Lowest block height in the network for a successful Unlock transaction.


=== Create the Unlock transaction

[CAUTION]
====
Wait to send an Unlock transaction, until the unlockable block height is reached in the network.
If you send the transaction too early, the token unlock will fail.

To verify, if tokens are ready to be unlocked, check the `unlockable` property in the <<checking-for-pending-tokens-ready-to-be-unlocked,pending token status>>.
