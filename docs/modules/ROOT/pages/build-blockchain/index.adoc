The "Build Blockchain" category contains all the guides related to the development of a blockchain application.

== Quickstart

The xref:{url_guide_quickstart}[] guide describes in a few simple steps how to set up a blockchain application and how to start it successfully for the first time.

== Guides for building blockchain applications

=== The Hello World application

How to create a very simple blockchain application by using the example of the "Hello World" blockchain application, which allows users to save hello messages in their accounts.

The following guides each focus on developing a specific part of the Hello application.

. xref:{url_guide_app}[]: How to bootstrap a default blockchain application.
. xref:{url_guide_module}[]: How to create a new module and how to add it to the application.
In the example, the `HelloModule` will contain all on-chain logic related to the hello message.
. xref:{url_guide_asset}[]: How to create a new asset and how to add it to a module.
. xref:{url_guide_genesisblock}[]: How to generate a new genesis block for a blockchain application.
In the example, the `HelloAsset` saves hello messages of users into their accounts, if they send a corresponding transaction.
. xref:{url_guide_plugin}[]: How to create a new plugin and how to add it to the application.
In the example, the `HelloPlugin` will contain one action, which will return the latest hello message which was sent to the network, and its sender address.
. xref:{url_guide_config}[]: Examples and descriptions how to configure a blockchain application.

The following image provides an overview of the "Hello" application:
