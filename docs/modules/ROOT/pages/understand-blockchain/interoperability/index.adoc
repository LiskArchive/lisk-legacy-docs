//TODO: Add link to certificate explanations
The Lisk interoperability solution allows blockchain to blockchain communication by using the paradigm of *cross-chain certification*.

Cross-chain certificates are a scalable and efficient solution that allows the passing of any kind of information between chains.

Basically, cross-chain certification means that information from one chain is authenticated and included in another chain utilizing a signed object called a *certificate*.
This information is transmitted across chains by issuing a Cross-Chain Update transaction, aka CCU.

The CCU includes the certificate and the cross-chain messages coming from the sending chain.
Cross-chain messages contain cross-chain commands which are executed on the receiving chain.
This can mutate the state of the receiving chain in response to state changes that happened on the sending chain.

.Example: Transferring tokens across different blockchains
image::understand-blockchain/interop/cc-transfer-example.png[,600]

In the diagram above, Alice performs a cross-chain token transfer from her account on the sending chain to Bob’s account on the receiving chain.

For this, she sends a cross-chain token transfer transaction, `t`, on the sending chain.
When this transaction is included, her account on the sending chain is debited.

Simultaneously, a corresponding cross-chain token transfer message, `m`, containing all the relevant information is emitted.
This message is included in a cross-chain update transaction (*CCU*), which is sent to the receiving chain.
When the transaction is included, Bob’s account is credited.

Cross-chain messages are, however, not limited to token transfers.
Similar to transactions, cross-chain messages have an `params` property.
Therefore, when building a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK, you can create custom cross-chain messages by defining the content of the `params` property as needed.
For example, you could create a custom cross-chain message that contains some authenticated information from an oracle chain in its `params` property.

== Terminology summary

[[tx]]
Transaction{fn_tx}::
An envelope object for a <<command,command>>.
[[cct]]
Cross-chain transaction (CCT)::
Transaction generating one or more <<ccm,cross-chain messages>>.
[[ccm]]
Cross-chain message (CCM)::
An envelope object for a <<ccc,cross-chain command>>.
[[ccu]]
Cross-chain update (CCU)::
A CCU, aka "Cross-chain update transaction" is a special transaction containing <<ccm,cross-chain messages>>, <<cert,certified by validators>>.
It is used to transfer CCMs from one chain to another.
[[command]]
Command{fn_command}::
Trigger of a state transition in the same chain.
[[ccc]]
Cross-chain command (CCC)::
Trigger of a state transition coming from another chain.
[[cert]]
Certificates::
Certificates contain information from finalized block headers that are signed by a large portion of validators from a certain chain, and thus authenticate a finalized state of that chain.
They are the fundamental components of the cross-chain certification paradigm for the Lisk ecosystem.

== Cross-chain network topology

The cross-chain network topology is organized as a **star topology** and describes arrangements of blockchains within the Lisk ecosystem.{fn_wiki_topology}

//TODO: Add link to network page, explaining network topology for Lisk blockchains

.Network topology of the Lisk blockchain ecosystem
image::understand-blockchain/interop/cross-chain topology.png[,500]

As shown by the image above, a Lisk blockchain can become interoperable to any other blockchain in the Lisk ecosystem including the Lisk Mainchain, simply by registering itself to the mainchain.
All communication to other sidechains is routed through the mainchain.

.What is the maximum of connected sidechains to the Lisk Mainchain?
[TIP]
====
The maximum number of sidechains that can be registered in the Lisk ecosystem is only capped by the maximum number of CCU transactions that the Lisk Mainchain can integrate.
In this sense, it is practically unlimited.
====

== Mainchain & sidechains

As explained in section <<cross-chain-network-topology>> above, the Lisk blockchain network is structured in two general kinds of network participants:
the *Lisk Mainchain*, and *sidechains*.

In the Lisk ecosystem, sidechains are connected to each other via the mainchain.

To become a sidechain in the Lisk ecosystem, a blockchain application needs to perform three simple steps:

. Register on the mainchain,
. Register the mainchain on the sidechain,
. Post a first CCU to start communicate with each other.

****
Each step of the lifecycle of a sidechain is explained in further detail on the page xref:{url_understand_sidechainlifecycle}[].
****

The *mainchain in that sense is a relayer for all cross-chain communication* happening in the network.
The token used on the mainchain, LSK, has a special role in the ecosystem, too:
All transaction fees in sidechains are paid in LSK by default, but it is possible to configure a sidechain token for the transaction fees.
Additionally, LSK is also used to pay transaction fees on the mainchain, where all CCUs from the sidechains have to be posted.

Structurally, the mainchain is not any different from any other sidechain.
Meaning, any sidechain could be used as mainchain, as long as it integrates the required interoperability modules.
Actually this means, that sidechains can also register directly on another sidechain, and breaking the star topology.
In most use cases though, this approach has the disadvantage that for each communication with another sidechain, a new registration process needs to be started, while registering a sidechain on the Lisk Mainchain will immediately provide interoperability with any other sidechain in the network.

.The Role of the LSK Token
[NOTE]
====
The LSK token is the only token that can be transferred to every chain within the Lisk ecosystem.
It is the default token for transaction fees on sidechains, but it is possible to configure a sidechain token for the transaction fees.
As the LSK token is listed on several exchanges and there are fiat on-ramps available, it will in most cases be the initial token that a user acquires within the Lisk ecosystem.
Once a user possesses some LSK tokens, they can exchange them for other sidechain tokens, e.g., on a decentralized exchange (DEX) sidechain.
====

Because of the network topology, there are two different ways for cross-chain communication:

Sidechain-to-Mainchain (& vice versa)::
Involves creation of one CCU on the sending chain, that is posted to the receiving chain.
Sidechain-to-Sidechain::
Involves creation of two CCUs:
+
. CCU from sending chain to mainchain
. CCU from mainchain chain to receiving chain

.Sidechain-to-Sidechain communication via the Mainchain: The color of a transaction or cross-chain message is always the one of the receiving chain, except for a cross-chain update transaction whose color is the one of the sending chain.
image::understand-blockchain/interop/s2s.png[,600]

* On `sidechain 1`, three transactions are included, where each one emits one cross-chain message, denoted by `m1`, `m2`, and `m3`.
* All three cross-chain messages are delivered in one cross-chain update transaction, `CCU1`, to the mainchain, where `m1` and m3 are processed, but not `m2`.
* Later on, `m2` is delivered to sidechain 2 by a cross-chain update transaction, `CCU2`, from the mainchain to `sidechain 2`.
* This cross-chain update transaction contains an additional cross-chain message, `m4`, emitted by the transaction `t4` included in the mainchain.

The cross-chain communication is explained in further detail on the page xref:{url_understand_ccc}[].

== Example of Interoperability Usage
Let’s look at an example to get a better impression of the capabilities of our interoperability solution.
All the following steps described here can also be seen in the image below.

Assume we have an exchange chain, a prediction market chain, and an oracle chain connected to the mainchain.
Then, a user story could look like this:

Assume a user has some LSK tokens on the mainchain, and they would like to bet on the prediction market chain, but this chain requires a special token for betting.
Therefore the following actions would apply:

. The user sends some of their LSK tokens to the exchange chain via a cross-chain token transfer message.
. The LSK tokens are then swapped for the betting tokens.
. Subsequently, the betting tokens are then sent from the exchange chain to the prediction market chain via a cross-chain token transfer message.
. On the prediction market chain, the user bets on the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics.
. After the announcement of the Nobel prize winner, the oracle chain sends the result to the prediction market chain via a custom cross-chain message.
. The user then receives their winnings as they made the correct guess.

.Lisk blockchain interoperability: Use case example
image::understand-blockchain/interop/high-level-overview-interoperability-fig_42x.png[,600]

Example of interoperability between the Lisk mainchain and three sidechains.

* The steps `2)`, `4)`, and `6)` are transactions performed within a single chain.
* The steps `1)`, `3)`, and `5)` are cross-chain messages.
* The cross-chain messages `3)` and `5)` are sidechain-to-sidechain cross-chain messages which are routed via the mainchain.
* The cross-chain message `1)` is a mainchain-to-sidechain cross-chain token transfer message.

Another example use case for Lisk interoperability was presented at Lisk.js 2021 by Alessandro Ricottone:
