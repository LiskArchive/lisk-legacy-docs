====
On this page, you'll learn how to:

* [x] Create a new blockchain event
* [x] Register the event in the module
* [x] Emit the event in the command execution hook
* [ ] Listen to the event.
For an example of how to listen to the event, check out the guide xref:{url_build_plugin}[]

Blockchain events, or module events, are logs of events that occur in the blockchain network during block execution.
Events occur per block, and are stored in the respective block header, from where they can be queried.

[CAUTION]
====
By default, a blockchain event is only stored for 300 blocks on-chain, then it is removed, to reduce the overall database size and increase scalability.

If desired, the number of blocks for which events are kept in the database can be increased in the node config under `system.keepEventsForHeights`.
====

For the Hello module, we implement a simple blockchain event as an example: The "New Hello" event.

This event should be emitted every time a new "Create Hello" command is executed on a node.

== Create a new event type

First, define the corresponding interface for the event.
Create a new file called `new_hello.ts` inside the `events/` folder of the module.

The event data shall contain the address of the sender of the Hello message, and the Hello message which was sent.

.hello_client/src/app/modules/hello/events/new_hello.ts
[source,typescript]
----
export interface NewHelloEventData {
	senderAddress: Buffer;
	message: string;
}
----

Define the corresponding schema directly below.
[#helloEvent]
.hello_client/src/app/modules/hello/events/new_hello.ts
[source,typescript]
----
export const newHelloEventSchema = {
	$id: '/hello/events/new_hello',
	type: 'object',
	required: ['senderAddress', 'message'],
	properties: {
		senderAddress: {
			dataType: 'bytes',
			fieldNumber: 1,
		},
		message: {
			dataType: 'string',
			fieldNumber: 2,
		},
	},
};
----

To create the event class, import the `BaseEvent` from the `lisk-sdk`.

.hello_client/src/app/modules/hello/events/new_hello.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { BaseEvent } from 'lisk-sdk';

export interface NewHelloEventData {
    //...
};

export const newHelloEventSchema = {
    //...
};

export class NewHelloEvent extends BaseEvent<NewHelloEventData> {
	public schema = newHelloEventSchema;
}
----

The new event class is created by extending from the `BaseEvent`.

Inside the event class, set the schema of the event data to `newHelloEventSchema`, which is defined above.

The `BaseEvent` class implements already a method `add()`, which can be used to emit the event, so there is nothing else required to be defined in the event.

The `schema` property is optional as well, and only required, if the event emits custom data.
Even without schema, it is still possible to signal that something happened, by logging an event.

== Register the event

Now that we created a new event type, import it into the `module.ts` file, and register the event in the module constructor.

.hello_client/src/app/modules/hello/module.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { NewHelloEvent } from './events/new_hello';
// [...]

export class HelloModule extends BaseModule {
    // [...]

    public constructor() {
        super();
        // registration of stores and events
        // [...]
        this.events.register(NewHelloEvent, new NewHelloEvent(this.name));
    }
    // [...]
}
----

== Emit the event

Now that the event is registered with the module, you can call the `add()` method of the event at any time inside the module.

In this example, we want to emit the "New Hello" event every time a "Create Hello" command was executed, so we add the corresponding logic at the end of the `execute()` command hook.

.hello_client/src/app/modules/hello/commands/create_hello_command.ts
[source,typescript]
----
// [...]
import { NewHelloEvent } from '../events/new_hello';

interface Params {
	message: string;
}

export class CreateHelloCommand extends BaseCommand {
	public schema = createHelloSchema;
	private _blacklist!: string[];

	// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/require-await
	public async init(config: ModuleConfig): Promise<void> {
        // [...]
	}

	// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/require-await
	public async verify(context: CommandVerifyContext<Params>): Promise<VerificationResult> {
        // [...]
	}

	public async execute(context: CommandExecuteContext<Params>): Promise<void> {
		// [...]

		// 6. Save the Hello counter to the counter store.
		await counterSubstore.set(context, helloCounterBuffer, helloCounter);

		// 7. Emit a "New Hello" event
		const newHelloEvent = this.events.get(NewHelloEvent);
		newHelloEvent.add(context, {
			senderAddress: context.transaction.senderAddress,
			message: context.params.message
		},[context.transaction.senderAddress]);
	}
}
----

Now, the module will create a new event every time a "Create Hello" command is executed, and the event will include the sender address and the Hello message which has been sent.

NOTE: An example of how to listen to a specific event, can be found in the guide xref:{url_build_plugin}[].
