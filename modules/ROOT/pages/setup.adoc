== Dependencies

The following dependencies must be installed in order to run applications created with the Lisk SDK:

include::partial$dependencies.adoc[]

[[ports]]
== Ports

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Mandatory:* Always open the *WebSocket* port of your desired network, to enable communication with other peer nodes.

*Optional:* Open the corresponding HTTP port for your network, to ensure your node’s xref:{url_core_api}[API] is reachable.
For more information, please see the diagram on the xref:{url_core_network}[Interact with network] page.
====

To connect to the desired network with Lisk Core, please ensure that the corresponding ports are open:

[options="header",]
|===
|Network |HTTP |WebSocket
|Devnet |4000 |5000
|===

These ports can be altered later in the xref:{url_guides_config}[configuration] file.

[[pre_install]]
== Prerequisites

=== Create a new user

[NOTE]
====
To install the required prerequisites, it is necessary to have a user with sudo rights on the server.
The `lisk` user itself *does not need* any `sudo` rights to run the node.
====

To run and manage a node in the future, please create a separate `lisk` user.
Please execute the following command:

[tabs]
=====
Ubuntu::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
sudo adduser lisk
----
--
MacOS::
+
--
It is not mandatory to set up a `lisk` user, especially when running a local instance for development purposes.
However, if it is required then it is recommended to create the user using the macOS GUI: {url_mac_support}
--
=====

=== Toolchain components

This is used for compiling dependencies.

[tabs]
=====
Ubuntu::
+

include::partial$install-node.adoc[]

=== PM2 (optional)

Install {url_pm2}[PM2] for managing the start/stop process of the application in the background by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
npm install pm2 -g
----

== Installation

To install the NPM package {url_npm_sdk}[lisk-sdk], please execute the following command:
