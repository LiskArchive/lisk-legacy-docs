//TODO: Add link to certificate explanations
The Lisk interoperability solution allows blockchain to blockchain communication by using the paradigm of *cross-chain certification*.

Cross-chain certificates are a scalable and efficient solution that facilitates the transfer of all kinds of information between chains.

Basically, cross-chain certification means that information from one chain is authenticated and included in another chain utilizing a signed object called a *certificate*.
This information is transmitted across chains by issuing a Cross-Chain Update transaction, aka CCU.

The CCU includes the certificate and the cross-chain messages coming from the sending chain.
Cross-chain messages contain cross-chain commands which are executed on the receiving chain.
This can mutate the state of the receiving chain in response to state changes that occurred on the sending chain.

.Example: Transferring tokens across different blockchains
image::understand-blockchain/interop/cc-transfer-example.png[,600]

In the diagram above, Alice performs a cross-chain token transfer from her account on the sending chain to Bob’s account on the receiving chain.

To achieve this, she sends a cross-chain token transfer transaction, `t`, on the sending chain.
When this transaction is included, her account on the sending chain is debited.

Simultaneously, a corresponding cross-chain token transfer message, `m`, containing all the relevant information is emitted.
This message is included in a cross-chain update transaction (*CCU*), which is sent to the receiving chain.
When the transaction is included, Bob’s account is credited.

Cross-chain messages are, however, not limited to token transfers.
Similar to transactions, cross-chain messages have a `params` property.
Therefore, when building a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK, you can create custom cross-chain messages by defining the content of the `params` property as needed.
For example, you could create a custom cross-chain message that contains some authenticated information from an oracle chain in its `params` property.

== Terminology summary

[[tx]]
Transaction{fn_tx}::
An envelope object for a <<command,command>>.
[[cct]]
Cross-chain transaction (CCT)::
Transaction generating one or more <<ccm,cross-chain messages>>.
[[ccm]]
Cross-chain message (CCM)::
An envelope object for a <<ccc,cross-chain command>>.
[[ccu]]
Cross-chain update (CCU)::
A CCU, aka "Cross-chain update transaction" is a special transaction containing <<ccm,cross-chain messages>>, <<cert,certified by validators>>.
It is used to transfer CCMs from one chain to another.
[[command]]
Command{fn_command}::
Trigger of a state transition in the same chain.
[[ccc]]
Cross-chain command (CCC)::
Trigger of a state transition coming from another chain.
[[cert]]
Certificates::
Certificates contain information from finalized block headers that are signed by a large portion of validators from a certain chain, and thus authenticate a finalized state of that chain.
They are the fundamental components of the cross-chain certification paradigm for the Lisk ecosystem.

== Cross-chain network topology

The cross-chain network topology is organized as a **star topology** and describes arrangements of blockchains within the Lisk ecosystem.{fn_wiki_topology}

//TODO: Add link to network page, explaining network topology for Lisk blockchains

.Network topology of the Lisk blockchain ecosystem
image::understand-blockchain/interop/cross-chain-topology.png[,500]

As shown by the image above, a Lisk blockchain can become interoperable with any other blockchain in the Lisk ecosystem including the Lisk Mainchain, simply by registering itself on the mainchain.
All communication to other sidechains is routed through the mainchain.

.What is the maximum number of connected sidechains to the Lisk Mainchain?
[NOTE]
====
The maximum number of sidechains that can be registered in the Lisk ecosystem is only capped by the maximum number of CCU transactions that the Lisk Mainchain can process.
In this sense, it is practically unlimited.
====

== Mainchain & sidechains

As explained in section <<cross-chain-network-topology>> above, the Lisk blockchain network is structured in two types of network participants:

* the *Lisk Mainchain*:  Follows the Lisk Mainchain protocol and cannot be modified by a blockchain application developer, and
* *sidechains*: Blockchain applications built with the Lisk SDK.
To become part of the Lisk blockchain ecosystem, they need to follow the Lisk protocol, for example, they need to include the Lisk Interoperability module.
All additional parts of the sidechain protocol are defined by the blockchain application developer.

In the Lisk ecosystem, sidechains are connected to each other via the mainchain.
Because sidechains communicate through the mainchain with other sidechains, they only need to maintain one connection to the mainchain, which will significantly reduce both the complexity and the point-of-failure.

To become a sidechain in the Lisk ecosystem, a blockchain application needs to perform the following three simple steps:

. Register on the mainchain.
. Register the mainchain on the sidechain.
. Post a first CCU to start communicate with each other.

****
Each step of the lifecycle of a sidechain is explained in further detail on the page xref:{url_understand_sidechainlifecycle}[].
****

The mainchain forwards all cross-chain communication happening between registered sidechains in the network.

//Commented out, because it is not yet true in the Sapphire phase
////
Structurally, the mainchain is not any different from any other sidechain.
This means that any sidechain could be used as the mainchain, as long as it integrates the interoperability module.
Furthermore, this also means that sidechains can also register directly on another sidechain, and therefore break the star topology.
Basically, this approach has the disadvantage that for each communication with another sidechain, a new registration process needs to be started, and the different connections need to be maintained continuously.
////

=== The Role of the LSK Token

The token used on the mainchain, LSK, has a special role in the ecosystem as described below:
LSK is used to pay transaction fees on the mainchain, where all CCUs from the sidechains have to be posted.
Additionally, all transaction fees in sidechains are paid in LSK by default (however, it is possible to configure a sidechain token for the transaction fees).

The LSK token is the only token that can be transferred to every chain within the Lisk ecosystem.
As the LSK token is listed on several exchanges and there are fiat on-ramps available, it will in most cases be the initial token that a user acquires within the Lisk ecosystem.
Once a user possesses some LSK tokens, they can exchange them for other sidechain tokens, e.g., on a decentralized exchange (DEX) sidechain.

=== Cross-chain communication

Due to the topology of the network, there are two different ways for cross-chain communication:

Sidechain-to-Mainchain (& vice versa)::
Involves the creation of one CCU on the sending chain, that is posted to the receiving chain.
Sidechain-to-Sidechain::
Involves the creation of two CCUs:
+
. CCU from sending chain to mainchain
. CCU from mainchain to receiving chain

.Sidechain-to-Sidechain communication via the mainchain: The color of a transaction or cross-chain message is always the one of the receiving chain, except for a cross-chain update transaction whose color is the one of the sending chain.
image::understand-blockchain/interop/s2s.png[,600]

* On `sidechain 1`, three transactions are included, where each one emits one cross-chain message, denoted by `m1`, `m2`, and `m3`.
* All three cross-chain messages are delivered in one cross-chain update transaction, `CCU1`, to the mainchain, where `m1` and `m3` are processed, but not `m2`.
* Later on, `m2` is delivered to `sidechain 2` by a cross-chain update transaction, `CCU2`, from the mainchain to `sidechain 2`.
* This cross-chain update transaction contains an additional cross-chain message, `m4`, emitted by the transaction `t4` included in the mainchain.

The cross-chain communication is explained in further detail on the page xref:{url_understand_ccc}[].

== Example of interoperability usage
Let’s look at an example to get a better impression of the capabilities of our interoperability solution.
All the following steps described here can also be seen in the image below.

Assume we have an exchange chain, a prediction market chain, and an oracle chain connected to the mainchain.
Then, a user story could look like this:

Assume a user has some LSK tokens on the mainchain, and they would like to bet on the prediction market chain, but this chain requires a special token for betting.
Therefore the following actions would apply:

. The user sends some of their LSK tokens to the exchange chain via a cross-chain token transfer message.
. The LSK tokens are then swapped for the betting tokens.
. Subsequently, the betting tokens are then sent from the exchange chain to the prediction market chain via a cross-chain token transfer message.
. On the prediction market chain, the user bets on the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics.
. After the announcement of the Nobel prize winner, the oracle chain sends the result to the prediction market chain via a custom cross-chain message.
. The user then receives their winnings as they made the correct guess.

.Lisk blockchain interoperability: Use case example
image::understand-blockchain/interop/high-level-overview-interoperability-fig_42x.png[,600]

Example of interoperability between the Lisk mainchain and three sidechains.

* The steps `2)`, `4)`, and `6)` are transactions performed within a single chain.
* The steps `1)`, `3)`, and `5)` are cross-chain messages.
* The cross-chain messages `3)` and `5)` are sidechain-to-sidechain cross-chain messages which are routed via the mainchain.
* The cross-chain message `1)` is a mainchain-to-sidechain cross-chain token transfer message.
