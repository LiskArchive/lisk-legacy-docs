==== Node.js

If you are using NVM ({url_nvm}[Node.js Version Manager]), install the correct version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install v16.18.0
----

==== Lisk Commander

It is recommended to install Lisk Commander globally with NPM (Node Packet Manager), to facilitate the convenient usage of the Lisk Commander CLI.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --global lisk-commander
----

To check the successful installation of Lisk Commander, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ lisk --version
lisk-commander/6.0.0 darwin-arm64 node-v16.18.0
----

=== Initializing a new blockchain client

In this example, we want to create a new client `hello_client`.

Create a dedicated folder `hello/`:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir hello
cd hello
----

Once you're in the dedicated `hello` folder, create another folder named `hello_client` which will contain the logic for the blockchain client.

A corresponding UI example for the blockchain client is added to the `hello` folder later in the xref:{url_integrate_ui}[] guide.

./hello/
[source,bash]
----
mkdir hello_client
cd hello_client
----

Inside the `hello_client`, execute the `init` command of Lisk Commander as shown below:

./hello/hello_client/
[source,bash]
----
lisk init
----

NOTE: The `init` command can be executed anywhere on the disk to bootstrap a sidechain client, however, to accommodate both *frontend* and the *sidechain client*, we have to create the aforementioned folders.

As a result of executing the `init` command, you will be asked for the *Name*, *ChainID*, *Description*, *Author*, and *License* of the blockchain client.

----
Using template "lisk-ts"
Initializing git repository
Updating .liskrc.json file
Creating project structure
? Application name hello_client
? Chain ID in hex representation. ChainID must be 4 bytes (8 characters) 12345678
? Application description A simple blockchain application that saves hello messages in user accounts.
? Author XYZ
? License ISC
----

Next, all the required files are created by Lisk Commander.

=== Using the client CLI globally

To use the client CLI commands globally, create an alias in the `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file depending on the operating system that you are using.

[tabs]
====
bashrc::
+
--
.~/.bashrc/
[source,bash]
----
alias hello_client="$HOME/hello_client/bin/run"
----
Add the path to where your `hello_client` is located.

After updating the `.bashrc` file, make it directly available in the terminal by executing the following:

[source,bash]
----
. ~/.bashrc
----
--
zshrc::
+
--
.~/.zshrc/
[source,bash]
----
alias hello_client="$HOME/hello_client/bin/run" 
----
Add the path to where your `hello_client` is located.

After updating the `.zshrc` file, make it directly available in the terminal by executing the following:

[source,bash]
----
. ~/.zshrc
----
--
====

Now it is possible to conveniently run these client CLI commands from anywhere by referring to the alias.

[source,bash]
----
hello_client --help
----

The above command will display the general xref:{url_references_cli}[CLI command reference]:

=== File & folder structure

The blockchain client will have the following file structure after the first initialization:

----
.
├── bin/ <1>
│   ├── run
│   └── run.cmd
├── config/ <2>
│   └── default/
│   │   ├── config.json
│   │   ├── dev-validators.json
│   │   ├── genesis_assets.json
│   │   ├── genesis_block.blob
│   │   └── passphrase.json
├── src/
│   ├── app/ <3>
│   │   ├── app.ts <4>
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   ├── modules/ <5>
│   │   ├── modules.ts <6>
│   │   ├── plugins/ <7>
│   │   └── plugins.ts <8>
│   └── commands/ <9>
├── test/ <10>
├── jest.config.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── readme.md
└── tsconfig.json
----

<1> `bin/`: Contains the script to run the CLI of the client.
<2> `config/`: Contains the configuration, dev-validators, genesis assets, genesis block, and passphrase files that are used by the application.
<3> `app/`: Contains the files of the blockchain client.
<4> `app.ts`: Creates the `Application` instance of the client.
<5> `modules/`: Contains modules of the client.
This folder is empty after the first initialization with the `lisk init`.
The command `lisk generate:module` creates a new module in this folder.
<6> `modules.ts` Registers the modules with the client.
<7> `plugins/`: Contains plugins of the client.
This folder is empty after the first initialization with `lisk init`.
The command `lisk generate:plugin` creates a new plugin in this folder.
<8> `plugins.ts` Registers the plugins with the client.
<9> `commands/`: Contains the logic for the CLI commands of the client.
The files for the different commands can be adjusted and extended as desired, for example, to include new flags and commands.
<10> `test/`: Contains the test files for the unit, functional, and integration tests.

These files create a ready-to-start blockchain client configured for a local devnet, which uses only the default modules of the Lisk SDK.

[#default-modules]
.Default modules
TIP: Lisk provides a range of *default modules* out of the box.
These modules are created automatically, whenever a blockchain client is bootstrapped via Lisk Commander.
The default modules provide basic blockchain functionality required by a blockchain client to work.
For more information, see the xref:{url_lisk_default_modules}[] page.

=== Starting the client
The client is created in the file `app.ts`:

.src/app/app.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { Application, PartialApplicationConfig } from 'lisk-sdk';
import { registerModules } from './modules';
import { registerPlugins } from './plugins';

export const getApplication = (config: PartialApplicationConfig): Application => {
	const { app } = Application.defaultApplication(config); //Creates a sidechain client with the default modules.
  
  // Will register additional modules to the client.
  // Currently, no additional modules are available for the client.
  // To add new modules update the `modules.ts` file.
	registerModules(app);

  // Will register additional plugins to the client.
  // Currently, no plugins are available for the client.
  // To add new plugins update the `plugins.ts` file.
	registerPlugins(app);

	return app;
};

----

In most cases, the <<default-modules,default modules>> don't need to be changed, as they provide the basic functionality that most blockchain clients need.
But in case you want to replace the default modules with other modules, you can also run the application without the default modules by replacing 

[source,typescript]
----
const { app } = Application.defaultApplication(config);
----
with

[source,typescript]
----
const app = new Application(config);
----

Please be aware that if you create the client with `const app = new Application(config);`, then you need to register all modules manually in the `app.ts` file.

This way it is also possible to include some, but not all the default modules in the client application.

To verify the successful bootstrap of the blockchain client, start it with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
hello_client start
----

The `start` command offers various options, allowing further configuration of the client.
For example, it is possible to define ports or to enable plugins for the client.
For a complete list of all available start options, visit the relevant xref:{url_references_cli_start}[client CLI reference].

Executing the `start` command should kick off the sidechain client, which is currently running with a local single-node development network.

Observe the displayed log messages in the console.
If no errors are thrown, the application will start to add new logs every 10 seconds after the initial startup.

Once it is verified that the client is functioning correctly, stop the client again with kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[C].

The corresponding application data can be found under the path `~/.lisk/hello_client/`, once the client starts successfully for the first time.

.~/.lisk/hello_client/

<1> `config.json` is the configuration file of the blockchain client.
<2> `dev-validators.json` contains the details of all the Devnet validators that generate a block.
<3> `genesis_assets.json` contains all the initial accounts and asset details.
It is used to create the genesis block for the blockchain.
<4> `genesis_block.blob` is the genesis block of the blockchain client.
<5> `passpharase.json` contains the passphrase of the Devnet validators.
<6> `data` contains the on-chain and off-chain data of the blockchain, data is stored in key-value stores.
<7> `logs` contains the file logs of the client and its plugins.
<8> `plugins` contains all the off-chain data relating to the plugins of the application, data is stored in key-value stores.
<9> `tmp` contains temporary data.

==== How to reset the database of a blockchain client

Once the client starts for the first time, it saves the client-specific data under the path `~/.lisk/hello_client/`.

To reset the database of the client, simply delete the folder with the client data:

[source,bash]
----
rm -r ~/.lisk/hello_client/data/
----

NOTE: Once removed, the *`hello_client/data`* folder is recreated automatically after the sidechain client starts again.

=== Next steps

By installing Lisk Commander and running `lisk init`, a functional blockchain client now exists with the default configurations for running in a local Devnet.

To extend the blockchain client further, it is required to register additional modules and/or plugins to the client.
