The xref:{url_lisk_sdk}[Lisk SDK] operates on the {nodejs}[Node.js^] runtime and consists primarily of an application framework (xref:{url_lisk_framework}[Lisk Framework]).
It contains a collection of libraries providing blockchain application functionalities (xref:{url_references_elements}[Lisk Elements]), and a powerful Command Line Interface (xref:{url_references_commander}[Lisk Commander]), which allows developers to bootstrap and manage their xref:{url_introduction_bapps}[].

== SDK components

[width="100%",cols="23%,77%",options="header",]
|===
| Component | Description
| xref:{url_references_framework}[Lisk Framework] | Lisk Framework is an application framework responsible for establishing and maintaining the interactions between the different xref:{url_introduction_bapps_diagram}[components of a blockchain application].

| xref:{url_references_elements}[Lisk Elements] | Lisk Elements is a collection of libraries, each of them implements a certain type of blockchain application functionality such as cryptography, transactions, p2p, etc.
Each library is designed to be compatible with xref:{url_protocol}[].

| xref:{url_references_commander}[Lisk Commander] | Lisk Commander is a command line tool which provides various commands to simplify the development and management of blockchain applications.
For example, it allows to xref:{url_guides_setup}[bootstrap] a complete blockchain application with just 1 command.
|===

== Application

The framework architecture is constructed of three different layers of abstractions: `Node`, `Modules` and `Plugins` (see the xref:{url_introduction_bapps_diagram}[architecture diagram] of a blockchain application).
The `Application` object encapsulates all together to provide a user-facing interface.

The `Application` class is the entry point to create a blockchain application.
It can be instantiated in the following two ways:

[source,js]
----
//Initiates the Application including all SDK default modules
const app = Application.defaultApplication(genesisBlock, config);
//Initiates the Application without the SDK default modules
const app = new Application(genesisBlock, config);
----

`genesisBlock` represents the <<genesis-block>> and `config` represents the <<configuration>> for the application.

.Recommended: Use the default application
[TIP]
The recommended method to create an `Application` instance is to use the *defaultApplication*, as it comes with the xref:{url_introduction_bapps_defaultmodules}[SDK default modules].
If the class constructor is used, all modules need to be registered manually.

== Configuration

The application config object is passed to the `Application` and must follow the configuration schema.

It is not necessary to include all options that are included in the schema.
The application will use the default configuration options in case a config option is not specified.

More information about how to configure a blockchain application can be found in the guide xref:{url_guides_config}[] and the xref:{url_references_config}[].


== Genesis block

The xref:{url_protocol_genesis_block}[genesis block] describes the very first block in the blockchain.
It defines the initial state of the blockchain at the start of the network.

The genesis block is not forged by a delegate, such as all of the other blocks which come after the genesis block.
Instead it is defined by the developer, when creating the Application instance of the blockchain application.

TIP: Check out the xref:{url_guides_genesis_block}[] guide to learn how to create a valid genesis block.

.Genesis block schema
[source,js]
----
const genesisBlock = {
  header: {
    generatorPublicKey: "",
    // height can be either 0 or regenesis height
    height: number,
    // empty buffer or merkle root of the previous blocks from previous network
    previousBlockID: Buffer,
    reward: 0n,
    signature: "",
    // timestamp of the blockchain in unix timestamp in second
    timestamp: number,
    // transactionRoot is alway empty hash
    transactionRoot: Buffer.from('e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855', 'hex'),
    version: 0,
    asset: {
      // number of initial round to use the initDelegates
      initRounds: number,
      // address of initial delegates
      initDelegates: Buffer[],
      // encoded accounts for the initial state
      accounts: Buffer[],
    },
  },
  payload: [],
}
----

== Life cycle of a block

If a node receives a new block, it always performs the following actions:

The colored steps are the steps exposed to the developer via the base module and base asset, see the xref:{url_references_framework_basemodule}[Lisk Framework reference].
