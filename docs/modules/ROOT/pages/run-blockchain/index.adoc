// TODO: Create a new section about enabling block generation in the public betanet.
// TODO: Uncomment the text once updated docs are available.

The "Run Blockchain" category contains all the guides concerning the management of a Lisk node and is therefore especially interesting for validators and other Lisk node operators.

== What is a blockchain node?

A blockchain node is a server with a running blockchain client, such as xref:{url_core}[].
Nodes are usually connected to other nodes running the same client via P2P.
Together, they form the network that is maintaining the blockchain.

.Various node types of a blockchain network
image::run-blockchain/node-service-network.png[Node network, 800]

In PoS, only a certain set of nodes is selected by the network to add new blocks to the blockchain.
These nodes fulfill a very important role in the network and therefore require certain additional configurations regarding enabling block generation and security measures, as compared to regular nodes.
Furthermore, they are equal to any non-validator node in the network and follow the same installation process.

== How to set up a Lisk Core node

Lisk Core is the blockchain client that maintains the Lisk Mainnet.

To set up Lisk Core, choose a distribution and follow the respective setup guide:

* *NPM:* xref:{url_core_setup_npm}[]
* *Binary:* xref:{url_core_setup_binary}[]
* *Snap:* xref:{url_core_setup_snap}[]
* *Docker:* xref:{url_core_setup_docker}[]
* *Source code:* xref:{url_core_setup_source}[]

== Validator nodes

A validator node is simply a node that has the enabled block generation feature for a particular validator, who is in an active validating position.
In the Lisk Mainnet, this means exactly 103 validators exist in the network for each block generation round.

Validator nodes are the only nodes that can propose new blocks to the blockchain.
During a block generation round, every validator node has the opportunity to generate at least one block.

// NOTE: Follow the guide xref:{url_run_forging}[Enable Block Generation] to learn how to enable block generation on a node for a particular validator.

// === Block Generation in the Testnet

// Anyone can start block generation in the Lisk Testnet, thanks to the the {url_faucet}[Lisk Testnet faucet^], where users can request free Testnet LSK tokens.

// The Lisk Testnet is the perfect network for users who want to test out how the block generation process works, or validators who want to test certain block generation setups before implementing them for their Mainnet validator.

// IMPORTANT: The Testnet LSK do not hold any intrinsic value, as the Lisk Testnet is a network purely for testing purposes.
// They can *never* be exchanged to real LSK tokens from the Lisk Mainnet.

// === Block Generation in the Mainnet

// If you consider gaining an active validator position on the Lisk Mainnet, please be aware that the Lisk PoS requires to xref:{url_glossary_selfstake}[self stake] with a certain amount of your own tokens.
// Therefore, a certain self-investment is required for every validator who wishes to participate in the block generation process.

// ==== Gaining an active validator spot

// To gain a secure validator spot for a block generation round, a validator needs to be one of the top 101 validators with the most xref:{url_glossary_validatorweight}[validator weight] in the network, see xref:{url_protocol_voting}[Validators, staking and validator weight] for more information about the staking process in the Lisk Protocol.

// To see the currently required thresholds for entering the top 101, check the validator weights of the currently actively 101 validator, for example in one of the public Lisk network explorers:

// * *Lisk Observer:* {url_observer}[^]
// * *Lisk Scan:* {url_liskscan}[^]

// ==== Earning rewards as standby validator

// With in each block generation round, two additional validators outside the top 101 are chosen randomly to gain an active validator spot for that particular round.
// This gives validators who don't have enough staking weights a chance to profit from block generation awards as well.

// The random selection of the two standby validators is proportional to their individual staking weight, meaning validators with higher staking weight have a higher chance of getting selected.
// See xref:{url_protocol_selection}[Validator selection] for more information.

// === Protecting forging nodes
// To keep the network healthy, and to not miss any block rewards, it is recommended to implement certain security measures to protect the forging node against attacks and/or failures.

// For more information, see the guide xref:{url_run_protection_forge}[].

== Nodes

Nodes are, as the name suggests, blockchain nodes without block generation enabled.
This means, non-validator nodes cannot add new blocks to the blockchain themselves, but they can receive and relay new blocks and transactions from and to other nodes in the network.

If not configured otherwise, every installed node is a non-validator node by default.

Generally, non-validator nodes are used to get data from or send data to the blockchain via one of the available APIs of the node.

Additionally, non-validator nodes can be used to create snapshots/backups of the blockchain, if desired.

// === Protecting non-validator nodes

// Opening a node's API to the public exposes the node to certain attacks, and it is recommended to protect the node accordingly, in order to ensure the node keeps running stable.

// For more information, see the guide xref:{url_run_protection}[].

=== APIs

The following APIs can be enabled in a blockchain node via the available communication protocols:

* *Supported communication protocols*: xref:{url_communication_protocol}[] 
* *RPC endpoints*: xref:{url_understand_endpoints}[]
// // * *HTTP API*: xref:{url_sdk_plugin_http}[]

// === How to enable the "Report Misbehavior" plugin

// * xref:{url_run_misbehavior}[]

== Lisk Service nodes

Lisk Service is a data aggregation service that connects to a particular blockchain node and aggregates the blockchain data, to provide enriched API endpoints for other applications and services that rely on data from the blockchain.

// === How to configure a blockchain node for Lisk Service

// To connect successfully to a blockchain node with Lisk Service, it is necessary to configure the node accordingly, by enabling the RPC API.

// See the section xref:{url_service_setup_docker_coreconfig}[Configuring Lisk Core] of the Lisk Service setup guide for a concrete example of how to configure Lisk Core so that Lisk Service can connect to it.

// === How to set up a Lisk Service node

// To set up Lisk Core, choose a distribution and follow the respective setup guide:

// * *Docker:* xref:{url_service_setup_docker}[]
// * *Source code:* xref:{url_service_setup_source}[]

// === APIs

// The following APIs can be enabled in a Lisk Service node:

// * *HTTP API*: xref:{url_api_service_http}[]
// * *RPC WS API*: xref:{url_api_service_rpc}[]
// * *Public/Subscribe API*: xref:{url_api_service_pubsub}[]

// == Further guides for node operators

// * xref:{url_run_reset}[]

// == Further guides for validators
