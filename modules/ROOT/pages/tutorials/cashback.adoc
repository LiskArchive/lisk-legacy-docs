A simple application which rewards the users for sending tokens.
The cashback reward tokens are freshly minted, and in turn increase the absolute amount of tokens within the network.

The Cashback Application implementation steps are shown below:

* *Steps 1-5* describes the node-side implementation of the blockchain application.
* *Step 6* shows how to interact with the network from the (blockchain) client-side using a node script.
* *Step 7* explains how to override specific config values.

TIP: Please see the *full code example* of the {url_github_cashback}[Cashback App on Github].

== 1. Installation & setup

Firstly, create the root folder for the Cashback Application and initialize the project:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir cashback <1>
cd cashback <2>
npm init --yes <3>
----

<1> Create the root folder for the blockchain application.
<2> Navigate into the root folder.
<3> Initialize the manifest file of the project.

The next step is to install the `lisk-sdk` package and add it to the project's dependencies.

=== Supported platforms

* Ubuntu 16.04 (LTS) x86_64
* Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) x86_64
* MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)
* MacOS 10.14 (Mojave)

=== Dependencies

[options="header"]
|===
|Dependencies |Version

|Node.js |12.15.0 or higher

|PostgreSQL |10+

|Redis (optional) |5+

|Python |2
|===

IMPORTANT: If some of the dependencies are missing, please go to xref:{url_setup_preinstall}[Lisk SDK - Pre-Install] and follow the pre-installation steps for the SDK.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --save lisk-sdk <1>
npm install --save @liskhq/lisk-validator @liskhq/lisk-cryptography @liskhq/lisk-transactions @liskhq/lisk-constants <2>
----

<1> Install the Lisk SDK as a dependency for the node server side.
<2> Install Lisk Elements dependencies for the client side scripts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is necessary to create a database before starting.
The default database name is lisk_dev, so for the development purposes, a command `createdb lisk_dev --owner lisk` can be used.
The default database user and password are as follows: lisk and password.
Naturally they can both be changed in the configuration of the Lisk SDK.
====

Please note: It is important to start with a fresh database.

[tabs]
====
Postgres system-wide::
+
--
For the *system-wide Postgres* installation:

[source,bash]
----
psql -c "DROP DATABASE lisk_dev"
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE lisk_dev OWNER lisk"
----
--
Postgres with Docker::
+
--
If you have installed xref:setup.adoc#_option_a_postgres_with_docker[Postgres with Docker], please run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -ti lisk_sdk_db psql -h localhost -U lisk -d postgres -c "DROP DATABASE lisk_dev"
docker exec -ti lisk_sdk_db psql -h localhost -U lisk -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE lisk_dev OWNER lisk"
----
--
====

Create the file `index.js`, which will hold the logic to initialize and start the blockchain application.

== 2. Configure the application

The next step is to provide the basic information about the application to be built.

Open the file `index.js` that was created with the previous step, and insert the following code:

.Contents of index.js
[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>

configDevnet.app.label = 'cashback-blockchain-app'; <2>
//configDevnet.components.storage.user = '<username>'; <3>
// configDevnet.components.storage.password = 'password'; <4>

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); <5>

app <6>
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
----

NOTE: See the complete file on Github: {url_github_cashback_index}[cashback/index.js].

<1> Require application class, the default genesis block and the default config for the application.
The necessary dependencies from the `lisk-sdk` package are required.
The most important one is the `Application` class, which is used in <5> shown above to create the application instance.
The application instance will start the whole application at the bottom of `index.js`.
<2> Set the name of the blockchain application.
<3> In case a different user than 'lisk' was used to access the database `lisk_dev`, it is necessary to update the username in the config.
<4> Uncomment this and replace `password` with the new password.
<5> The application instance is created.
By sending the parameters for the xref:{url_guides_congig_genesis_block}[genesis block] and the {url_github_sdk_config}[configuration template], the application is configured with the most basic configurations to start the network.
<6> The code block below starts the application and does not need to be changed.

TIP: If it is required to change any of the values for `configDevnet`, please see the xref:{url_reference_config}[full list of configurations] for Lisk SDK and overwrite them as described in <<step7,step 7>>

After adding the code block above, save and close `index.js`.
At this point it is now possible to start both the node and network, in order to to verify that the setup was successful:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short
----

`node index.js` will start the node, and `| npx bunyan -o short` will pretty-print the logs in the console.

If everything is correct, the following logs will be displayed:

....

To stop the blockchain process, press kbd:[CTRL+C].

== 3. Create a new transaction type

To create a new xref:{url_customize}[custom transaction type] , such as  `CashbackTransaction` please see the description shown below:
This extends the pre-existing transaction type `TransferTransaction`.
The difference between the regular `TransferTransaction` and the `CashbackTransaction`, is that the Cashback transaction type also pays out a 10% bonus reward to its sender.

For example, if Alice sends 100 tokens to Bob as a Cashback transaction, Bob would receive the 100 tokens and Alice would receive an additional 10 tokens as a cashback.

image:cashback_diagram.png[Business logic of a cashback transaction]

[NOTE]
====
If a comparison is made with the methods below with the methods implemented in the `HelloTransaction`, it is evident that fewer methods are used for the `CashbackTransaction`.
This is due to the fact that the `CashbackTransaction` is extended from an already existing transaction type `TransferTransaction`.
As a result, all required methods are implemented already inside the `TransferTransaction` class, and it is only necessary to overwrite/extend explicitly the methods required to be customized.
====

[WARNING]
====
*General advice:* Please be aware that if the custom transaction type is extended from an already existing Transaction type, the logic might by affected by future changes in the codebase of the transaction type, from whereby it was extended from.
Therefore, it is recommended to keep an eye on future changes for the transaction type, or alternatively just use the xref:{url_customize_basetx}[BaseTransaction] as the basis for the required transaction type.
====

To execute this, create and open the file `cashback_transaction.js` and insert the following code shown below:

.Contents of cashback_transaction.js
[source,js]
----
const {
    transactions: { TransferTransaction },
    BigNum,
} = require('lisk-sdk');

class CashbackTransaction extends TransferTransaction {

    /**
    * Set the Cashback transaction TYPE to `11`.
    * The first 10 types, from `0-9` is reserved for the default Lisk Network functions.
    * Type `10` was used previously for the `HelloTransaction`, so it is set to `11`, but any other integer value (that is not already used by another transaction type) is a valid value.
    */
    static get TYPE () {
        return 11;
    }

    /**
    * Set the `CashbackTransaction` transaction FEE to 0.1 LSK.
    * Every time a user posts a transaction to the network, the transaction fee is paid to the delegate who includes the transaction into a block that the delegate forges.
    */
    static get FEE () {
        return `${10 ** 7}`;
    };

    /**
    * The CashbackTransaction adds an inflationary 10% to senders account.
    * Invoked as part of the apply() step of the BaseTransaction and block processing.
    */
    applyAsset(store) {
        super.applyAsset(store);

        const sender = store.account.get(this.senderId);
        const updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus = new BigNum(sender.balance).add(
            new BigNum(this.amount).div(10)
        );
        const updatedSender = {
            ...sender,
            balance: updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus.toString(),
        };
        store.account.set(sender.address, updatedSender);

        return [];
    }

    /**
    * Inverse of applyAsset().
    * Undoes the changes made in `applyAsset` step: It sends the transaction amount back to the sender and substracts 10% of the transaction amount from the senders account balance.
    */
    undoAsset(store) {
        super.undoAsset(store);

        const sender = store.account.get(this.senderId);
        const updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus = new BigNum(sender.balance).sub(
            new BigNum(this.amount).div(10)
        );
        const updatedSender = {
            ...sender,
            balance: updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus.toString(),
        };
        store.account.set(sender.address, updatedSender);

        return [];
    }
}

module.exports = CashbackTransaction;
----

TIP: See the file on Github: {url_github_cashback_tx}[cashback/cashback_transaction.js]

After adding the code block above, save and close `cashback_transaction.js`.

== 4. Register the new transaction type

At this stage the current project should contain the following file structure:

....
cashback
├── cashback_transaction.js
├── index.js
├── node_modules
└──package.json
....

Add the new transaction type to the application by registering it to the application instance inside of `index.js`.

NOTE: It is only necessary to add 2 new lines (number <2> and <7>) shown below to your existing `index.js`, to register the new transaction type.

.Contents of index.js
[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>
const CashbackTransaction = require('./cashback_transaction'); <2>

configDevnet.app.label = 'cashback-blockchain-app'; <3>
//configDevnet.components.storage.user = '<username>'; <4>
configDevnet.components.storage.password = 'password'; <5>

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); <6>

app.registerTransaction(CashbackTransaction); <7>

app <8>
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
----

TIP: See the file on Github: {url_github_cashback_index}[cashback/index.js].

<1> Require application class, the default genesis block and the default config for the application.
<2> *New line*: Require the newly created transaction type 'CashbackTransaction'.
<3> Change the label of the app.
<4> If a different user name than 'lisk' to access the database lisk_dev was used, then it is necessary to update the username in the config.
<5> Replace the existing password with the password for the database user.
<6> Create the application instance.
<7> *New line*: Register the 'CashbackTransaction'.
<8> The code block below starts the application and does not need to be changed.

After adding the 2 new lines to your `index.js` file, save and close it.

== 5. Start the network

It is now possible to start the customized blockchain network for the first time.

The parameter `configDevnet`, which is passed to the `Application` instance in step 3, is preconfigured to start the node with a set of dummy delegates, that have enabled forging by default.

These dummy delegates stabilize the new network and make it possible to test out the basic functionality of the network with only one node immediately.

This creates a simple Devnet, which is beneficial during development of the blockchain application.

[NOTE]
====
The dummy delegates can be replaced with real delegates later.
To accomplish this, the users are required to create new secret accounts, and register themselves as delegates on the network.
Then the account(s) with the most tokens need to unvote the dummy delegates, and vote for the newly registered delegates instead.
====

To start the network, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short
----

Check the logs to verify that the network has started successfully.

If an error occurs the process should stop, and the error with the debug information will be displayed.

== 6. Interact with the network

Now the network is running, try to send a `CashbackTransaction` in order to check that the node accepts this.

[NOTE]
====
As the blockchain process is running in the current console window, it is necessary to open a new window to proceed with the tutorial.
Ensure to navigate into the root folder of the blockchain application in the new console window.
====

In the new terminal window, create a new folder `client`, this will hold the client-side scripts.

[source,bash]
----
cd cashback <1>
mkdir client <2>
cd client <3>
----

<1> Open the root folder of the Cashback application.
<2> Create the folder for the client-side scripts inside the cashback folder.
<3> Navigate into the client folder.

Inside the `client` folder, create the file that will hold the code to create the transaction object: `print_sendable_cashback.js`

Open the file `print_sendable_cashback.js` and insert the following code:

.Content of client/print_sendable_cashback.js
[source,js]
----
const CashbackTransaction = require('../cashback_transaction');
const transactions = require('@liskhq/lisk-transactions');
const { EPOCH_TIME } = require('@liskhq/lisk-constants');

const getTimestamp = () => {
    // check config file or curl localhost:4000/api/node/constants to verify your epoc time
    const millisSinceEpoc = Date.now() - Date.parse(EPOCH_TIME);
    const inSeconds = ((millisSinceEpoc) / 1000).toFixed(0);
    return  parseInt(inSeconds);
};

const tx = new CashbackTransaction({
    amount: `${transactions.utils.convertLSKToBeddows('2')}`,
    fee: `${transactions.utils.convertLSKToBeddows('0.1')}`,
    recipientId: '10881167371402274308L', //delegate genesis_100
    networkIdentifier: 'a59352e01fa66bd4fa270af5d47a8f827c56b36b2d80528b04e1e8ba03134de9',
    timestamp: getTimestamp(),
});

tx.sign('wagon stock borrow episode laundry kitten salute link globe zero feed marble');

console.log(tx.stringify());
process.exit(0);
----

TIP: See the complete file on Github: {url_github_cashback_client}[cashback/client/print_sendable_cashback.js].

This script will print the transaction in the console, when executed.

NOTE: Python’s `json.tool` is used to prettify the output

[source,bash]
----
node print_sendable_cashback.js | python -m json.tool
----

The generated transaction object should look like this:

.Signed Transaction object
[source,json]
----
{
   "id":"5372254888441494149",
   "amount":"200000000",
   "type":11,
   "timestamp":3,
   "senderPublicKey":"c094ebee7ec0c50ebee32918655e089f6e1a604b83bcaa760293c61e0f18ab6f",
   "senderId":"16313739661670634666L",
   "recipientId":"10881167371402274308L",
   "fee":"10000000",
   "signature":"0a3f41cc529f9de523cadc7db64e9436014d1b10ca2158bbce0469e8e76dfd021358496440da43acaf64d0223d3514609fc1aa41646be56353207d88a03b1305",
   "signatures":[],
   "asset":{}
}
----

Now a sendable transaction object exists, send it to the node and it will be processed by analyzing the logs.

The HTTP API of the node is now utilized, and the created transaction object is now posted to the transaction endpoint of the API.

Before posting the transaction it is recommended to check the balances of the sender and recipient, in order to verify that the transaction was applied correctly:

IMPORTANT: Ensure the node is running, before sending any API requests.

To check the account balance of the sender, execute the following commands below:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/accounts?address=16313739661670634666L" -H "accept: application/json" | python -m json.tool
----

.Response from api/accounts endpoint with initial balance of the sender
[source,json]
----
{
  "meta": {
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 10
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "address": "16313739661670634666L",
      "publicKey": "c094ebee7ec0c50ebee32918655e089f6e1a604b83bcaa760293c61e0f18ab6f",
      "balance": "10000000000000000",
      "secondPublicKey": ""
    }
  ],
  "links": {}
}
----

Checking the account balance of the recipient:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/accounts?address=10881167371402274308L" -H "accept: application/json" | python -m json.tool
----

[NOTE]
====
It is possible the account data of `10881167371402274308L` contains more info than the account data of `16313739661670634666L`.
This is simply because `10881167371402274308L` is a registered delegate.
Therefore additional information such as the delegates name and the vote weight are stored in the accounts database entry.

Due to the fact that the API of every node is only accessible from the localhost by default, it is necessary to execute this query on the same server that the node is running on, unless the config to <<step7,make your API accessible>> to others, or to the public was changed.

IMPORTANT: Ensure the node is running, before sending the transaction.

.POST the transaction to the local node
[source,bash]
----
node print_sendable_cashback.js | tee >(curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- localhost:4000/api/transactions) <1>
----

<1> Posts the tx object to the node and displays it on the console.

If the node accepted the transaction, the response should be as follows:

....
{"meta":{"status":true},"data":{"message":"Transaction(s) accepted"},"links":{}}
....

To verify that the transaction was included in a block:

NOTE: Use the  `id`   of the transaction object which was posted to the node in the previous step.

****
In this example, the sender was sending 2 LSK to the recipient, and paid a transaction fee of 0.1 LSK. +
Simultaneously, the sender receives a cashback of 10% of the transaction amount: 2 LSK * 10% = 0.2 LSK.

As a result, the recipient should receive a credit of 2 LSK, and *the sender's balance should then be reduced by 1.9 LSK* +
(-2 LSK, plus a credit of 0.1 LSK [= 0.2 LSK (cashback) - 0.1 LSK (tx fee)] = -1.9 LSK).
****

NOTE: The balance of an account is stored in Beddows.
1 LSK = 100000000(= 10^8) Beddows.

Verify that the sender's account balance is reduced by 1.9 LSK by executing the following command below:

If the balances are equal to the expected values, then it is verified with the new custom transaction type `CashbackTransaction` , and is successfully integrated into the application.

For further interaction with the network, it is possible to run the process in the background by executing the following:

[source,bash]
----
cd cashback <1>
pm2 start --name cashback index.js <2>
pm2 stop cashback <3>
pm2 start cashback <4>
----

<1> Navigate into the root folder of the Cashback application.
<2> Add the application to pm2 under the name 'cashback'.
<3> Stop the cashback app.
<4> Start the cashback app.

[NOTE]
====
PM2 needs to be installed on the system in order to run these commands.
Please see xref:setup.adoc#_pre_installation[SDK Pre-Install section].
====

[[step7]]
== 7. Customize the default configuration

The new project should have now the following file structure:

....
cashback
├── client
│   └── print_sendable_cashback.js
├── cashback_transaction.js
├── index.js
├── node_modules
└── package.json
....

To run the script remotely, change the configuration before creating the `Application` instance in order to make the API accessible as shown below:

TIP: For more configuration options, please see the xref:{url_reference_config}[full list of configurations] for Lisk SDK.

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>
const CashbackTransaction = require('./cashback_transaction'); <2>

configDevnet.app.label = 'cashback-blockchain-app'; <3>
//configDevnet.components.storage.user = '<username>'; <4>
//configDevnet.components.storage.password = 'password'; <5>

configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.public = true; <6>
//configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.whitelist.push('1.2.3.4'); <7>

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); <8>

app.registerTransaction(CashbackTransaction); <9>

app <10>
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
----

<1> Require application class, the default genesis block and the default config for the application.
<2> Require the newly created transaction type 'CashbackTransaction'.
<3> Set the name of your blockchain application.
<4> In case a different user than `lisk` is used to access to the database lisk_dev, it is necessary to update the username in the config.
<5> Uncomment this and replace `password` with the new password for your database user.
<6> Make the API accessible from everywhere.
<7> Example how to make the API accessible for specific IP addresses: add 1.2.3.4 IP address as whitelisted.
<8> Create the application instance.
<9> Register the 'CashbackTransaction'.
<10> The code block below starts the application and does not need to be changed.

[NOTE]
====
*Optional:* After the first successful verification, it is possible to reduce the default console log level (info), and file log level (debug).
This can be completed by sending a copy of the config object `configDevnet` with the customized config for the logger component as shown below:

[source,js]
----
configDevnet.components.logger.fileLogLevel = "error"; <1>
configDevnet.components.logger.consoleLogLevel = "none"; <2>
----

<1> This will log errors and also fatal errors in the log file.
<2> This will result in no logs being visible in the console.
====

For the next step a wallet software can be used.
For example, a customized {url_lisk_desktop}[Lisk Desktop], so that the users can utilize the new transaction type.

Please also see the following section: xref:{url_core_network}[Interact with the network].
