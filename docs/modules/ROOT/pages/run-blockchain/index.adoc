The "Run Blockchain" section contains all the guides concerning the management of a Lisk node and is therefore especially interesting for validators and other Lisk node operators.

== What is a blockchain node?

A blockchain node is a server with a running blockchain client, such as xref:{url_core}[].
Nodes are usually connected to other nodes running the same client via P2P.
// TODO: (See above comment on P2P) - Add in P2P link {url_p2p}[P2P^].
Together, they form the network that is maintaining the blockchain.

Depending on the node configuration, a node can have different roles in the network.
In the Lisk ecosystem, a node can be any one of the following four types.

. <<RPC nodes>>
. <<Validator nodes>>
. <<Relayer nodes>>
. <<Lisk Service nodes>>


.Various node types deployed in blockchain network
image::run-blockchain/node-service-network.png[Node network, 800]

=== RPC nodes

// === Protecting non-validator nodes

// Opening a node's API to the public exposes the node to certain attacks, and it is recommended to protect the node accordingly, in order to ensure the node keeps running stable.

// For more information, see the guide xref:{url_run_protection}[].

If the RPC API of a node is enabled, it allows external services to send queries to the node and/or to subscribe to specific events that are happening in the network.
For example, these *external services* could be other scripts in JS, a Python daemon, a tool in Rust, etc.
Depending on the node configuration, an xref:{url_communication}[RPC node] can accept different communication protocols such as {url_wiki_http_protocol}[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)^], {url_websocket}[WebSocket (WS)^], and {url_wiki_ipc}[Inter-Process Communication (IPC)^].

For more information, see the following:

* *Supported communication protocols*: xref:{url_communication_protocol}[].
* *RPC endpoints*: xref:{url_understand_endpoints}[].
// * *HTTP API*: xref:{url_sdk_plugin_http}[]

=== Validator nodes

//TODO: Add link to Lisk PoS explanation, once it is available
In the Lisk xref:{url_pos}[PoS], a certain set of validators is selected by the network to add new blocks to the blockchain.
To participate in the block generation process, a validator needs to set up a node and configure it to enable block generation.
These nodes are called *validator nodes*.

In the Lisk Mainnet, exactly 103 validators exist in the network for each block generation round.
Validator nodes are the only nodes that can propose new blocks to the blockchain.
During a block generation round, every validator node has the opportunity to generate at least one block.

Validator nodes fulfill a very important role in the network, and therefore they require certain additional configurations regarding enabling block generation and higher security measures, as compared to regular nodes.
Furthermore, they are equal to any non-validator node in the network and follow the same installation process.

NOTE: For more information on how to become a validator and enable block generation, check out the following section about <<how-to-setup-a-validator-node, How to set up a Validator node>>.

////
=== Block Generation in the Testnet

Anyone can start block generation in the Lisk Testnet, thanks to the the {url_faucet}[Lisk Testnet faucet^], where users can request free Testnet LSK tokens.
The Lisk Testnet is the perfect network for users who want to test out how the block generation process works, or validators who want to test certain block generation setups before implementing them for their Mainnet validator.

IMPORTANT: The Testnet LSK do not hold any intrinsic value, as the Lisk Testnet is a network purely for testing purposes.
They can *never* be exchanged to real LSK tokens from the Lisk Mainnet.

=== Block Generation in the Mainnet

If you consider gaining an active validator position on the Lisk Mainnet, please be aware that the Lisk PoS requires to xref:{url_glossary_selfstake}[self stake] with a certain amount of your own tokens.
Therefore, a certain self-investment is required for every validator who wishes to participate in the block generation process.
////

// ==== Earning rewards as standby validator

// With in each block generation round, two additional validators outside the top 103 are chosen randomly to gain an active validator spot for that particular round.
// This gives validators who don't have enough staking weights a chance to profit from block generation awards as well.

// The random selection of the two standby validators is proportional to their individual staking weight, meaning validators with higher staking weight have a higher chance of getting selected.
// See xref:{url_protocol_selection}[Validator selection] for more information.

// === Protecting forging nodes
// To keep the network healthy, and to not miss any block rewards, it is recommended to implement certain security measures to protect the forging node against attacks and/or failures.

// For more information, see the guide xref:{url_run_protection_forge}[].




=== Relayer nodes
Nodes from different chains are able to interact with one another in the Lisk ecosystem, and this interaction is carried out via relayer nodes.
Any chain such as a mainchain or a sidechain can have relayer node(s).

Relayer nodes are nodes of a blockchain that are configured to relay Cross-Chain Updates (CCUs) and Cross-Chain Messages (CCMs) to another blockchain{fn_lips}.
Consider blockchain A with 20 nodes, out of which, a node is configured to act as a relayer node.
The job of this relayer node is to collect CCUs & CCMs from other nodes of blockchain A and then pass them on to the receiving blockchain B.
Once configured, a relayer node can directly connect with the RPC and validator nodes of the receiving chains.

To become a relayer node, Lisk provides an easy-to-use plugin called the Chain Connector.
The chain connector plugin allows a node to act as a relayer of CCUs and CCMs.
A relayer node can be configured for both mainchain and sidechains.


=== Lisk Service nodes

{url_github_lisk_service}[Lisk Service^] is a data aggregation service that connects to a particular <<rpc-nodes,RPC node>> and aggregates the blockchain data, to provide enriched API endpoints for other applications and services that rely on data from the blockchain.

//TODO: Check this, update it so that it will be ready to add in when the NWs are available
// === How to configure a blockchain node for Lisk Service

// To connect successfully to a blockchain node with Lisk Service, it is necessary to configure the node accordingly, by enabling the RPC API.

// See the section xref:{url_service_setup_docker_coreconfig}[Configuring Lisk Core] of the Lisk Service setup guide for a concrete example of how to configure Lisk Core so that Lisk Service can connect to it.

// === How to set up a Lisk Service node

// To set up Lisk Core, choose a distribution and follow the respective setup guide:

// * *Docker:* xref:{url_service_setup_docker}[]
// * *Source code:* xref:{url_service_setup_source}[]

//TODO: Check this, update it so that it will be ready to add in when the NWs are available
// no APIs available yet for new version
// === APIs

// The following APIs can be enabled in a Lisk Service node:

// * *HTTP API*: xref:{url_api_service_http}[]
// * *RPC WS API*: xref:{url_api_service_rpc}[]
// * *Public/Subscribe API*: xref:{url_api_service_pubsub}[]

// Further guides for node operators

=== How to set up a Lisk Mainnet node

Lisk Core is the blockchain client that maintains the Lisk Mainnet.

To set up Lisk Core, choose a distribution and follow the respective setup guide:

* *NPM:* xref:{url_core_setup_npm}[]
* *Binary:* xref:{url_core_setup_binary}[]
* *Snap:* xref:{url_core_setup_snap}[]
// * *Docker:* xref:{url_core_setup_docker}[]
* *Source code:* xref:{url_core_setup_source}[]

=== How to set up a Relayer node

== How to set up a Validator node

Related guides::

* xref:{url_validator}[]
* xref:{url_enable_block_gen}[]
* xref:{url_staking}[]

If you are intending to generate blocks for the first time, it is highly recommended to first check out the dedicated guide: xref:{url_validator}[How to become a validator].
Furthermore, to acquire a secure validator spot for a block generation round, a validator must be one of the top 103 validators with the most xref:{url_validator_weight}[validator weight] in the network.
To view the currently required thresholds for entering the top 103, check the validator weights of the currently active 103 validators, for example, in one of the public Lisk network explorers:

* *Lisk Observer:* {url_observer}[^]
* *Lisk Scan:* {url_liskscan}[^]

////
== Report Misbehavior plugin

The "Report Misbehavior" plugin is a useful tool that is designed to provide the node operators with the option to report any suspicious or malicious activity.
In essence, it is a mechanism that allows the reporting of any fraudulent activities/transactions, misbehavior, security issues, and possible congestion that may impede and impact the security and stability of the network.
Furthermore, once implemented it provides automatic detection of delegate misbehavior and informs the running node.

For further in-depth information and how to set up the "Report Misbehavior" plugin, please see the following guide: xref:{url_enabling_misbehavior}[Enabling report misbehavior] in this section.
