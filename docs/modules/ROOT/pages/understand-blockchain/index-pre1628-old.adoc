In the "Understand blockchain" category you learn the basic concepts of blockchain applications, including how they are structured and which topics and terms are important to know when developing within the Lisk ecosystem.

This page explains the three domains of a blockchain, and gives introduction to blocks and transactions.

== The three domains of a blockchain

At a high level, there are three domains of a blockchain:

.The three domains of a blockchain application
image::understand-blockchain/3-domains.png["3 domains of blockchain", 300, align="center"]

. **Application domain**: Responsible for verifying data and transitioning the blockchain state with deterministic logic via the xref:{url_understand_state_machine}[state machine].
. xref:{url_understand_consensus}[Consensus domain]: Responsible for the replication of the same sequence of states among all nodes in the network.
This is achieved by nodes in the network following a xref:{url_intro_consensus}[consensus protocol] and utilizing the application and network domains.
. xref:{url_understand_network}[Network domain]: Responsible for the communication of the peer-to-peer network.

== Blocks

Blocks following the Lisk protocol have three main properties:

. <<block-header>>: includes properties relevant to the xref:{url_understand_consensus}[consensus] domain.
. <<block-assets>>: an array of objects containing data injected by the blockchain application during the block creation.
. <<transactions>>: The transactions included in the block.
Each block can include a maximum of 15 kB of transactions.

.Anatomy of a block
image::understand-blockchain/block.png["Anatomy of a Lisk block",300,align="center"]

Detailed descriptions of the main properties of a block are provided in the following sections.

.Block JSON schema
[%collapsible]
====
Blocks are serialized and deserialized accordingly to the following JSON schema.

=== Block header

Properties handled by the xref:{url_understand_consensus}[consensus] domain are added to the block header.

.Block ID
NOTE: The block ID is calculated by hashing the complete block header of a signed block.

The most important properties of the block header are:

* `timestamp`: Time the block was created as Unix timestamp.
* `height`: The height of a block is always `= height of the previous block + 1`.
* `previousBlockID`: The ID of the previous block.
* `generatorAddress`: The address of the block generator{fn_gpk}.
* `transactionRoot`: The transaction root is the root of the Merkle tree built from the ID of the <<transactions,transactions contained in the block>>.
* `stateRoot`: The root of the sparse Merkle tree that is computed from the state of the blockchain.
The state root is the root of the sparse Merkle tree built from the state of the chain after the block has been processed{fn_stateroot}.

Beside the above properties, each block header contains various additional properties, required for deeper technical aspects of the blockchain application.
Expand below boxes for a description of the additional properties, and see the JSON schema for an overview of all properties included in the header.
Check {url_lip55}[LIP 0055^] for additional information about the block header.

.Remaining properties of the block header
[%collapsible]
====
* `version`: The block header version must be equal the value of a block of the previous protocol plus one.
* `assetRoot`: The root of the Merkle tree computed from the <<block-assets>> array.
* `eventRoot`: The root of the sparse Merkle tree that is computed from the events emitted during the block processing{fn_eventroot}.
//TODO: Add link to Lisk BFT explanation
* `maxHeightPrevoted`: This property is related to the Lisk-BFT protocol and is used for the fork choice rule.
//TODO: Add link to Lisk BFT explanation
* `maxHeightGenerated`: This property is related to the Lisk-BFT protocol and is used to check for contradicting block headers.
//TODO: Add link to Lisk interoperability explanation about certificates
* `validatorsHash`: This property authenticates the set of validators active from the next block onward.
It is important for cross-chain certification and included in certificates.
* `aggregateCommit`: This property contains the aggregate BLS signature for a certificate and the height of the certified block.
It attests that all signing validators consider the corresponding block final.
Based on this, any node can create a certificate for the given height{fn_aggregate}.
* `signature`: Signature of the validator who created the block.

    }
  }
}

=== Block assets

Block assets allow the blockchain application to store specific data inside of each block.

//TODO: Add link to state-machine page, merkle trees
Each entry of the block assets is then inserted in a Merkle tree, whose root is included in the <<block-header>> as the `assetRoot` property.

NOTE: Inserting the assets root rather than the full assets allows to bound the size of the block header to a fixed size, while still authenticating the content of the block assets.

As an example, blockchains created with the Lisk SDK that implement the Random module, will insert the seed reveal property in the block assets.

==== JSON schema

The schema for the block assets allows each xref:{url_understand_sdk_modules}[module] to include its serialized data individually, which makes the inclusion of module data very flexible.

Each module can insert a single entry in the assets.
This entry is an object containing a `moduleID` property, indicating the ID of the module handling it, and a generic data property that can contain arbitrary serialized data.

    },
    "data": {
      "dataType": "bytes",
      "fieldNumber": 2
    }
  }
}
----
====

== Transactions

Transactions are sent to the blockchain application by its users to trigger state mutations on the blockchain.

To be accepted by the blockchain application, the transactions must be transmitted in the expected format, including all the required properties of a transaction, and pass the transaction & command verification steps explained in the <<block-processing>> process description.

Valid transactions trigger the corresponding xref:{url_understand_sdk_commands}[command] of a module that accepts this transaction type.
Therefore, each transaction always needs to include the IDs of the module and command that the transaction wants to trigger.
If any specific data input from the user is needed to complete the command, they are included under the `params` property of a transaction.
Beside this, there are a few additional properties which every transaction should contain, which are described in image _Figure 3_ and below.

//TODO: Add link to tx pool explanation
After a transaction is sent to a node, it is first added to the transaction pool, waiting to be included in a block.
The transactions to be included in the block are then always picked from there.

.Properties of a transaction object
image::understand-blockchain/transaction.png["Transaction properties",300, align="center"]

* `moduleID`: An integer identifying the module the transaction is addressing.
* `commandID`: An integer identifying the specific command in the module.
* `nonce`: An integer which is *unique for each transaction* from the account corresponding to the `senderPublicKey`.
Increments by `+1` for each transaction.
* `fee`: An integer that specifies the *fee in Beddows* to be spent by the transaction.
* `senderPublicKey`: The public key of the account issuing the transaction.
A valid public key is 32 bytes long.
* `params`: The *serialized parameters* of the module command.
* `signatures`: An array with the signatures of the transaction.
A transaction is signed by the sender account to verify its correctness.
In case of a multi-signature transaction, several accounts need to sign a transaction, before it is accepted by a node.

.How many transactions fit in a block?
[NOTE]
====
How many transactions can actually fit into a block?
The answer to this question very much depends on the size of the particular transactions.
As every transaction type expects a different set of params to be included in the transaction, the size of transactions can vary significantly between different transaction types.

Let's make an example for simple token transfer transactions.
If you assume all transactions are the simplest token transfers (Alice sends 5LSK to Bob etc.) then the size of each transaction is 153 Bytes.
Each block can include a maximum of 15 kB of transactions.
This results in maximum 100 token transfer transactions per block:

 Total transactions size  = 15360 (15 x 1024)
 transaction size = 153

 15360/153 = 100.39 maximum token transfer transactions per block

=== Valid vs invalid transactions

Only valid transactions should be added to a block during the block generation, as an invalid transaction makes the whole block invalid, meaning that it would be discarded by any node in the network.

A transaction is *valid*, if the following stages associated to the transaction of <<block-processing>> are executed successfully without errors:

* "transaction verification"
* "command verification"
* "before command execution" and
* "after command execution"

Otherwise, a transaction is *invalid*.

=== Successful vs failed transactions
A valid transaction is executed *successfully* if additionally the "command execution" stage of <<block-processing>> is executed successfully without errors.

A valid transaction *fails* if on the other hand an error occurs during the command execution.
In this case, all state transitions of the "command execution" stage are reverted.
This means that the transaction has no effect except for those defined in "before command execution" and "after command execution".
The result of the transaction execution is logged using an event emitted at the end of the "after transaction execution" stage, indicating whether the transaction was processed successfully or an error occurred.

== Block generation

The block generation flow offers a lot of flexibility for custom business logic of the blockchain application by providing hooks for executing additional custom logic before and after each execution of a transaction and/or command.
The gradual steps make all important verification steps explicit and obvious.

image::understand-blockchain/block-generation.png["Block generation steps",500, align="center"]

The full generation of a block is organized as follows.

. **Header initialization**: Block header properties that require access to the state store before any state transitions implied by the block are executed are inserted in this stage.
+
Sets the `version`, `timestamp`, `height`, `previousBlockID`, `generatorAddress`, `maxHeightPrevoted`, `maxHeightGenerated`, and `aggregateCommit` properties of the <<block-header>>.
. **Assets insertion**: Each module can insert information in the block assets.
. **Before transactions execution**: Each module can define protocol logic that is executed before the transactions contained in the block are processed.
After this stage has been completed, transactions are selected one-by-one from a transaction pool.
. **Transaction verification**: Each module can define protocol logic that verifies a transaction, possibly by accessing the state store.
If an error occurs, the transaction is invalid and it is not included in the block.
The transaction processing stages (steps 4 to 8) are repeated for each transaction selected.
If step 4, 5, 6, and 8 are executed successfully, the transaction is valid and it is included in the block, otherwise it is invalid and therefore discarded.
. **Command verification**: The command corresponding to the `moduleID`-`commandID` combination is verified.
If an error occurs, the transaction is invalid and it is not included in the block.
. **Before command execution**: Each module can define protocol logic that is processed before the command has been executed.
If an error occurs, the transaction is invalid, it is not included in the block, all state transitions induced by the transaction are reverted.
In that case, the block generation continues with step 4 for another transaction from the transaction pool or step 9.
. **Command execution**: The command corresponding to the `moduleID`-`commandID` combination is executed.
If an error occurs, the transaction is failed and all state transitions performed in this stage are reverted.
In any case, afterwards the processing continues with the next stage.
. **After command execution**: Each module can define protocol logic that is processed after the command has been executed.
If an error occurs, the transaction is invalid, it is not included in the block and all state transitions induced by the transaction performed up to this stage are reverted.
In that case, the block generation continues with step 4 for another transaction from the transaction pool or step 9.
. **After transactions execution**: Each module can define protocol logic that is executed after all the transactions contained in the block have been processed.
. **Header finalization**: Block header properties, which require accessing the state store after all state transitions implied by the block have been executed, are inserted.
+
Sets the `transactionRoot`, `assetRoot`, `eventRoot`, `stateRoot`, `validatorsHash`, and `signature` properties of the <<block-header>>.
. **Block processing**: The block goes through the <<block-processing>> stages.

== Block processing

The block processing flow offers a lot of flexibility for custom business logic of the blockchain application by providing hooks for executing additional custom logic before and after each execution of a transaction and/or command.
The gradual steps make all important verification steps explicit and obvious.

image::understand-blockchain/block-processing.png["Block prosessing steps",500, align="center"]

The full processing of a block is organized as follows.

. **Block reception**: A new block is received from the P2P network.
//TODO: Add link to definition of the fork choice rule
. **Fork choice**: Upon receiving a new block, the fork choice rule determines whether the block will be discarded or if the processing continues.
. **Static validation**: Some initial static checks are done to ensure that the serialized object follows the general structure of a block.
These checks are performed immediately because they do not require access to the state store and can therefore be done very quickly.
* Validates, if:
** the block follows the block schema.
** the total size of the serialized transactions contained in the block is at most the maximum allowed size for transactions per block.
** the block header is valid:
*** checks that the block header follows the block header schema.
*** validates the `version`, `transactionRoot`, and `assetRoot` properties.
** the block assets are valid:
*** each entry in the assets array has `moduleID` set to the ID of a module registered in the chain
*** the data property has size at most equal to the max size of an assets entry in bytes.
*** each module can insert at most one entry in the block assets.
*** the entries are sorted by increasing values of `moduleID`.
. **Header verification**: Block header properties that require access to the state store before any state transitions implied by the block are executed are verified in this stage.
+
Verifies `timestamp`, `height`, `previousBlockID`, `generatorAddress`, `maxHeightPrevoted`, `maxHeightGenerated`, `aggregateCommit`, and `signature` properties of the <<block-header>>.
. **Assets verification**: Each module verifies the respective entry in the block assets.
If any check fails, the block is discarded and has no further effect.
. **Block forwarding**: After the initial checks, the full block is forwarded to a subset of peers.
. **Before transactions execution**: Each module can define protocol logic that is executed before the transactions contained in the block are processed.
. **Transaction verification**: Each module can define protocol logic that verifies a transaction, possibly by accessing the state store.
If an error occurs, the transaction is *invalid* and the whole block is discarded.
. **Command verification**: The command corresponding to the `moduleID`-`commandID` combination is verified.
If an error occurs, the transaction is *invalid* and the whole block is discarded.
. **Before command execution**: Each module can define protocol logic that is processed before the command has been executed.
If an error occurs, the transaction is *invalid* and the whole block is discarded.
. **Command execution**: The command corresponding to the `moduleID`-`commandID` combination is executed.
If an error occurs, the transaction is *failed* and all state transitions performed in this stage are reverted.
In any case, afterwards the processing continues with the next stage.
. **After command execution**: Each module can define protocol logic that is processed after the command has been executed.
If an error occurs, the transaction is *invalid* and the whole block is discarded.
. **After transactions execution**: Each module can define protocol logic that is executed after all the transactions contained in the block have been processed.
. **Result verification**: Block header properties, which require accessing the state store after all state transitions implied by the block have been executed, are verified.
+
Verifies the `stateRoot`, `eventRoot`, and `validatorsHash` properties of the <<block-header>>.
. **Block storage**: The block is persisted into the database.
. **Peers notification**: Other peers in the P2P network are notified of the new block.
