== Creating issues

. Go to the product-specific GitHub repository, for example the {url_github_core}[Lisk Core repository^], and check that no issue regarding the topic has already been previously created.
. *Create a new issue*:
.. Choose the fitting issue template and then perform the following:
.. Fill out the issue description as *clearly* and *detailed* as possible.
. Go to the {url_jira_docs}[Lisk Docs Jira board^]:
. *Create a new story*:
.. Copy the summary from the GitHub issue created in step 2.
.. Copy the description from the GitHub issue.
.. Paste the link to the GitHub issue under the *GitHub URL*.

== Working on issues

. *Assign yourself* to the issue in *Jira*.
. Click on the GitHub URL and assign yourself to the issue on *GitHub*.
. Navigate inside the product-specific repository (e.g. Lisk Core), check out the `development` branch and pull the latest changes.
. *Create a new branch* to work on the issue.
.. Give it a descriptive name, and prepend the number of the issue created before.
. Move the corresponding Story in Jira to the column "IN PROGRESS".
. Work locally on the issue.
. *Create a pull request* to merge your branch into `development`.
. When the PR is ready for review, *request a review* from a developer familiar with the product and a docs team member.
.. *Notify the reviewers* about the review in the `#lisk-docs` channel via Slack.
.. Create the corresponding *subtasks in Jira* and assign the reviewers.
. Once the PR is approved by all reviewers, it will be merged automatically.
. Once the PR is merged, move the respective Jira Story to the "DONE" column.

NOTE: In case the issue is related to a previous version of the product, the corresponding base branch / tag for the version should be chosen as the base for working on the issue, instead of `development`.
