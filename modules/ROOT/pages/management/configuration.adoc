== Using a network-specific default configuration

To quickly connect your Lisk Core node to a specific network, specify the desired network with the `--network` or `-n` flag.

This will use the default config file for the specific network when starting Lisk Core.
The default configurations are located in the `config` folder of Lisk Core.

[source,bash]
----
$ lisk-core start --network=NETWORK <1>
----

<1> `NETWORK` may be `mainnet`, `testnet` or `devnet`.

== Using a custom config file

Lisk Core uses the default config for connecting to the mainnet by default.

However, it is possible to use Lisk Core with a custom config, by specifying the path to the config file with the `--config` or `-c` flag.

The custom config file needs to follow the JSON config structure of Lisk Core.
A straightforward and easy method is to copy one of the network-specific default configs of Lisk Core and adjust it to suit your requirements.

./home/lisk/
[source,bash]
----
cp .lisk/lisk-core/config/testnet/config.json custom-config.json
vim custom-config.json
----

NOTE: If you intend to connect the node to the mainnet, change `testnet` to `mainnet` in the snippet above.

[source,bash]
----
$ lisk-core start --config=/home/lisk/custom-config.json --overwrite-config
----

//NOTE: Remember to xref:{url_pm2_restart}[restart] the node for the new config changes to take effect.

== Enabling plugins

Plugins are not enabled by default.
Use the dedicated flags to enable them on application start:

[source,bash]
----
$ lisk-core start --enable-report-misbehavior-plugin
----

Alternatively, enable the plugins directly in the config file, see <<using-a-custom-config-file>>.

[TIP]
====
For more detailed descriptions of the available plugins, go to the xref:{url_sdk_plugins}[].

// See also xref:{url_enable_pom}[] and xref:{url_config_start}[Lisk Core CLI: start]
See also xref:{url_enable_pom}[] and `Lisk Core CLI: start` command.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using the Docker image, Lisk Core is configured in a slightly different manner.
Please go to the xref:{url_docker}[Docker image commands] page to find out more regarding the docker-specific configuration of the Lisk Core.

[[network_specific_config]]
== Network-specific config files

The root folder for all configurations is `config/`.
The *default* network is `devnet`.
To connect to another network, specify the `network` when starting the Lisk Core as described in xref:{url_config}[Config reference].
The *network specific configurations* can be found under `config/<network>/config.json`, whereby `<network>` can be any of these values listed below:

* `devnet`
* `betanet`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not override any value in the files mentioned above, as the changes will be overwritten everytime the Lisk Core is upgraded.
If a custom configuration is required, use the environment variables or alternatively create your own `.json` file and pass it as xref:{url_config_clo}[command line option].
====


== Custom config file

Only the values required to be overwritten are necessary.
For all other options the pre-defined values will be used as described in the <<order, Config Load Order>> section.

[NOTE]
====
The *Application* and *Commander application* both provide a `config.json`, which can be customized as desired.

For the *Source code*, the config file needs to be created separately and needs to be passed as described below:
====

[tabs]
=====
Application::
+
--
The Lisk Core application provides a custom `config.json` which is stored in the root folder of your Lisk Core installation by default.

For example, if Lisk Core is installed under `~/lisk-beta`, then the config is stored directly in `~/lisk-beta/config.json`.

The updated `config.json` will be used automatically when reloading the node with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
bash lisk.sh reload
----
--
Commander application::
+
--
Lisk Commander provides a custom `config.json` which is stored in the root folder of your Lisk Core instance by default.

For example, if Lisk Core is installed under `~/.lisk/instances/lisk-betanet`, then the config is stored directly in `~/.lisk/instances/lisk-beta/config.json`.

The `config.json` will be used automatically when reloading the node with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
lisk core:restart lisk-betanet
----
--
Source code::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
pm2 stop lisk <1>
LISK_CONFIG_FILE=<CONFIG_PATH> pm2 start lisk <2>
----
<1> Stop Lisk Core in the case whereby it is running.
<2> Replace `<CONFIG_PATH>` with the path to your custom config file.
