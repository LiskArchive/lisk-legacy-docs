The {url_references_dashboard_plugin}[Dashboard plugin^] offers various features that facilitate interaction with a Lisk application.
The Dashboard can be registered with any Lisk Application.

For this guide, the Dashboard plugin is registered to the xref:{url_guides_setup}[Hello World application], though the steps mentioned below can be applied to any Lisk-based blockchain client.

====
On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] Registration of the Dashboard plugin to a blockchain client.
* [x] Interacting with a node via the Dashboard plugin such as invoking commands, endpoints and subscribing to events, etc.
====

== Plugin registration

With Lisk v6, the default plugins come pre-installed after an application is initiated.
You can check the `package.json` file of the blockchain client to ensure the installation.

.hello_client/package.json
[source,json]
----
"dependencies": {
	"@liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin": "0.2.0",
	//[...]
},
----

Otherwise, you can install the Dashboard plugin like this:

[source,bash]
----
npm i @liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin
----

Now open the `plugins.ts` file, import the Dashboard plugin, and register it with the application as shown below:

.src/app/plugins.ts
[source,typescript]
----
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-empty-function */
import { Application } from 'lisk-sdk';
import { DashboardPlugin } from '@liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin';
//[...]

export const registerPlugins = (app: Application): void => {
   	//[...]
    app.registerPlugin(new DashboardPlugin());
};
----

Save and close the `plugins.ts` file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is essential to enable WS API and configure the `allowedMethods` property before registering the `DashboardPlugin`.
For more information, see the configurations described in the xref:{url_guides_config_hello}[configuration guide].
====

After updating the *custom_config.json* file, build the blockchain client again:

[source,bash]
----
npm run build
----

== Starting the node

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to enable the Dashboard plugin without updating the `plugins.ts` file as suggested in the aforementioned steps.
Once the plugin is installed, you can add the `--enable-dashboard-plugin` flag to the `start` command to run the node.

[tabs]
=====
Sidechain::
+
--
* Start the blockchain client with designated flags on a `sidechain` node.
+
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start --config=config/custom_config.json --enable-dashboard-plugin
----
--
Mainchain::
+
--
* *Or*, start the blockchain client with designated flags on a `mainchain` node.
For more information, see xref:{url_network_page}[Networks], xref:{url_mainchain_page}[Mainchain] and the xref:{url_coreIndex_page}[Lisk Core] docs.
+
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core start --network testnet --enable-dashboard-plugin
----
--
=====
====

If you registered the Dashboard via `plugins.ts`, then:

.Start the blockchain client with 'custom_config.json' without any flag
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start --config=config/custom_config.json 
----

Wait until the application start has been completed.
Now it is possible to access the Dashboard on the browser under `localhost: 4005`

You can also see the blockchain client logs to confirm the registration of the Dashboard plugin.

[source,bash]
----
2023-07-28T08:42:18.189Z INFO XYZ.local application 92756 dashboard Loading in-memory plugin
----

== Dashboard walkabout

Go to http://localhost:4005[^] to access the Dashboard.

=== Invoke command

The Dashboard plugin allows you to invoke various commands via the *Invoke command* section.

The *Invoke command* section lists all the module-based commands registered to a node. 

The command type is selected from the dropdown box.

As we registered the `DashboardPlugin` with the `hello_client`, it is possible to send a hello message via the Dashboard.

.Select the 'hello_createHello' command.
image::guides/dashboard/send_tx_dropdown.png["Transaction dropdown",750,align="center"]

Once the desired command type is selected, provide the `passphrase` of the sender account and the hello `message`.

The passphrase is present in the `passphrase.json` file, which is located in the `config/default` directory of the blockchain client.

You can use the {url_gitHub_passphrase}[passphrase^] of the `genesis` account of `hello_client`.

The hello message can be:

[source,json]
----
{
	"message": "Greetings from Lisk!"
}
----

Once all the necessary parameters are input, click on the kbd:[Submit] button.

.Enter information about the hello message
image::guides/dashboard/send_tx_hello.png["Send transaction",750,align="center"]

If the transaction was successfully accepted, you will see the following confirmation:

.Send 'createHello' transaction to node
image::guides/dashboard/send_tx_success.png["Transaction Sent successfully",1000,align="center"]

Once the transaction is confirmed and added to the chain, it can be seen in the *Recent Transaction* section.

.Recent transactions
image::guides/dashboard/recent_transactions.png["Recent transactions",750,align="center"]

=== Call endpoints

It is possible to invoke endpoints of registered Modules and Plugins via the Dashboard.
Endpoints can be invoked from the *Call endpoint* section. 

In the previous guides, the following endpoints were created:

.*For Module:*
. The endpoint `hello_getHello` is for xref:{url_guides_module_getHello}[Getting the latest Hello for an address].

.*For Plugin:*
. The endpoint `helloInfo_getMessageList` is for xref:{url_guides_plugin_getMessageList}[Getting a list of all Hello messages sent onchain].

Let's see, how to invoke each endpoint:

==== Invoking `hello_getHello`

To verify that the hello message was sent successfully, select the `hello_getHello` endpoint from the section *Call endpoint*.

The `hello_getHello` endpoint is part of the xref:{url_guides_module_endpoints}[HelloModule endpoints] and it returns the last sent hello message for the account address that is specified in the endpoint input.

Provide the `address` to which the passphrase belongs.
For `hello_client` the passphrase points to the first account in the {url_dev_validator}[dev-validators.json^] file, which is located in the `config/default` directory of the hello client.

.Enter an address to fetch the latest hello message
image::guides/dashboard/call_action.png["Invoke hello_getHello",750,align="center"]

In response, the Dashboard will display the latest hello message sent from the specified account.

.Latest hello message from the given account
image::guides/dashboard/call_action_success.png["Get latest hello message for the given account",1000,align="center"]


==== Invoking `helloInfo_getMessageList`

Select `helloInfo_getMessageList` from the dropdown menu.

You can directly click on the kbd:[Submit] button to view the results.
The endpoint doesn't require any input for the request to proceed.

.Select the 'helloInfo_getMessageList' endpoint
image::guides/dashboard/call_pluginaction.png["Invoke plugin action",750]

As expected, the plugin responds with the latest hello message that was posted to the blockchain application.

.List of all the hello messages sent on chain
image::guides/dashboard/call_pluginaction_success.png["Plugin action success",1000]


=== Subscribing to events

At the bottom of the Dashboard is the *Recent events* window, which allows the possibility to subscribe to various events by selecting them from a dropdown box.

Select the `hello_newHello` event.

.Subscribe to the 'newHello' event
image::guides/dashboard/subscribe_event.jpg["Subscribe to newHello event", 1000,align="center"]

Once a new hello transaction is posted, the newHello event is also published subsequently and will show up in the *Recent events* window.

image::guides/dashboard/receive_newHello_event.png[]

[TIP]
==== 
The value of the `senderAddress` retrieved in the `hello_newHello` event is in the `hex` format, which can be easily converted to the Lisk32 format through the `cryptography` package.
For example:

[source,js]
----
lisk.cryptography.address.getLisk32AddressFromAddress(Buffer.from("8ebe46d631ae4cc7ad14ba5235edde56c5f34ec6", 'hex'));
----
For more information, see {url_typedoc_crypto}[getLisk32AddressFromAddress^].
====

The Dashboard plugin provides various other features as well, most of which are very self-explanatory.
For example, you can create new accounts, see unconfirmed transactions, and see recently generated blocks.
You can also see general node and network information, etc through the Dashboard plugin.
