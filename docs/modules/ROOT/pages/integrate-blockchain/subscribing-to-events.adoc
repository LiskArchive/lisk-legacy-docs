====
On this page you'll learn about how events can be subscribed to, or retrieved from a Lisk blockchain.

Specifically the following topics are covered:

. Lisk application
.. The difference between WS events and blockchain events
.. Subscribing to a WS event
.. Retrieving a blockchain event
. Lisk Service
.. Subscribing to events
====

== Lisk Application

=== The difference between WS events and blockchain events

The xref:{url_lisk_blockchain}[Lisk blockchain] generates various events that emit on-chain data.

// update the following links etc., regarding RPC : now WS and not RPC
// The emitted events can either be xref:{url_understand_rpc_events}[xxxWS Events] or xref:{url_understand_blockchain_events}[Blockchain Events].
The emitted events can either be xref:{url_understand_ws_events}[WebSocket] or xref:{url_understand_blockchain_events}[Blockchain] events.
The aforementioned events are different in terms of when and how they are *generated*, and also how these events can be *accessed*.

// Lisk makes *WS events* accessible to everyone by offering xref:{url_understand_events}[a range ofxxxWS  RPC-based events].

Lisk makes *WS events* accessible to everyone.
These events can be subscribed to by anyone in the network.
The subscribers can then get real-time information about the subscribed event, for example, the generation of a new block on the network, the addition of a new transaction in the transaction pool, a round state change event, etc.
WS events offered by Lisk can be subscribed to directly by any plugin, external service, or application.

The other type of event emitted by Lisk is *blockchain events*. 
Such events cannot be directly subscribed to with the RPC protocol. 
Blockchain events are usually emitted at a modular level, during block execution and they reside in the event log.
The event log keeps the blockchain events emitted from the latest set of blocks.
Blockchain events can have information about a successful or failed transaction, among other information. 
For more information on events and events root, see {url_lip_65}[LIP 65].

[NOTE]
====
The number of events stored by the event log depends on the configuration of the node. 
By default, a node is *configured to store the blockchain events from the latest 300 blocks* in the event log. 
Due to this, events from only those 300 blocks can be retrieved, by default. 
This can be changed by updating the `*keepEventsForHeights*` property in the xref:{url_sdk_config_system}[node configuration].

To store the blockchain events on a node permanently, set `*keepEventsForHeights*` to `-1` in the node configuration.

[[the-api-client]]
=== Subscribing to a WS event

The API client simplifies the WS event subscription process not only for a blockchain client but also for the external plugins and services.
With the Lisk API client, it is possible to subscribe to the *WS events* both over IPC and WS.

An API client can be imported into any JS client application as shown in the following snippets.

// TIP: To conveniently communicate with a blockchain node, use the `apiClient` included in the xref:{url_references_elements_client}[@liskhq/lisk-client] and the {url_npm_lisk_sdk}[lisk-sdk^] packages.
TIP: To conveniently communicate with a blockchain node, use the `apiClient` included in the `@liskhq/lisk-client` and the `lisk-sdk` packages.

WS API client example::
+
--
[source,js]
----
const { apiClient } = require('@liskhq/lisk-client');
let clientCache;
const nodeAPIURL = 'ws://localhost:7887/rpc-ws';

const getClient = async () => {
    if (!clientCache) {
        clientCache = await apiClient.createWSClient(nodeAPIURL);
    }
    return clientCache;
};

getClient().then((client) => {
    client.subscribe('network_newBlock', ( data ) => {
    console.log('new block: ',data);
    });
});

IPC API client example::

[source,js]

const { apiClient } = require('@liskhq/lisk-client');
let clientCache;

const getClient = async () => {
    if (!clientCache) {
        clientCache = await apiClient.createIPCClient('~/.lisk/my-app');
    }
    return clientCache;
};

getClient().then((client) => {
    client.subscribe('network_newBlock', ( data ) => {
    console.log('new block: ',data);
    });
});

=== Retrieving a blockchain event

With each block execution, various events are generated and stored in the event log.
For example, modules such as `Reward` emit the `rewardMinted` event after each block execution.

NOTE: In contrast to WS events, blockchain events cannot be directly subscribed to.
Instead, *blockchain events are requested for a particular block height* and are provided as a parameter in the request.

To fetch such an event, we can use the xref:{url_chain_get_event}[chain_getEvents] endpoint, as shown below:

.fetchBlockchainEvent.js
[source,js]
----
const { apiClient } = require('@liskhq/lisk-client');
const { codec } = require('@liskhq/lisk-codec');
let clientCache;
const nodeAPIURL = 'ws://127.0.0.1:7887/rpc-ws'

const getClient = async () => {
    if (!clientCache) {
        clientCache = await apiClient.createWSClient(nodeAPIURL);
    }
    return clientCache;
};

const rewardMintedDataSchema = {
    $id: '/reward/events/rewardMintedData',
    type: 'object',
    required: ['amount', 'reduction'],
    properties: {
        amount: {
            dataType: 'uint64',
            fieldNumber: 1,
        },
        reduction: {
            dataType: 'uint32',
            fieldNumber: 2,
        },
    },
};

getClient().then((client) => {
    // Returns the encoded event based on the 'height' passed
    client.invoke("chain_getEvents", {
        height: 60
    }).then(res => {
        console.log("Event: ", res);
        // Decode the aforementioned event's data by passing relevant schema and the encoded 'data'
        const parsedData = codec.decode(rewardMintedDataSchema, Buffer.from(res[0]['data'], 'hex'));
        console.log(parsedData);
    });
});
----
Once an event is retrieved from the event log, its `data` property can be decoded by using the `codec.decode()` function. This function takes in the encoded data and the relevant schema as arguments. 

The `codec.decode()` function is available inside the *@liskhq/lisk-codec* package.

[TIP]
====
A detailed example of xref:{url_create_blockchain_event}[emitting a blockchain event], xref:{url_sync_store}[fetching it, and decoding it] is available in the Hello World blockchain example.

== Lisk Service
=== Subscribing to events
The Lisk Service Subscribe API allows subscribing to events to receive real-time updates or notifications, as shown in the examples below.
A detailed list of all available emitted events are available in the xref:{url_lisk_service_pubsub}[Publish/Subscribe API (Lisk Service)] page.
