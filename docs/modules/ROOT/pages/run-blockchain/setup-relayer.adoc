On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to set up a relayer node on a sidechain?
* [x] How to set up a relayer node on a mainchain?
====

The process of setting up a xref:{url_relayer_node}[relayer node] on a mainchain and sidechain are almost identical.
The subsequent sections describe the steps to set up a relayer node.

.Prerequisites
[NOTE]
====
To use this guide, it is assumed that the following criteria have been met:

* An up-and-running node connected to the mainchain exists, see xref:{url_mainnet_node}[How to set up a Lisk Mainnet node].
* An up-and-running node connected to the sidechain exists.
* The sidechain must be registered to the mainchain as described in the xref:{url_guides_reg_sidechain}[] guide.
* The sidechain account on the mainchain must have either the `registered` or `active` status.

== Installing the Chain Connector plugin

The chain connector plugin comes pre-installed with any chain that has been initialized with Lisk SDK v6.
However, in case it is required to install it manually, run the following command in the root folder of the client.

[source,bash]
----
npm install @liskhq/lisk-framework-chain-connector-plugin
----
== Configuration
To set up a relayer node, one needs to set up the node according to the following configurations:

=== Configuring the Chain Connector plugin
Once the plugin is installed, various configurations are available for the node operator to set.
With these configurations, the details such as the receiving chainâ€™s chainID and its IPC path or WS URL, CCU frequency, encrypted private key, etc. can be set.

The following table describes the available configuration options.

IMPORTANT: A node operator must add either the value of `*receivingChainIPCPath*` or `*receivingChainWsURL*` in the chain connector's config.

=== Configuring the `system`

Before we discuss how to set up a node to act as a relayer node, we need to understand the concept of prefixes, how to retrieve them, and how to calculate `inclusionProofKeys`.

==== What are Prefixes and how to get them?

We can get the `MODULE_PREFIX` and the `SUBSTORE_PREFIX` from the xref:{url_system_getmetadata}[system_getMetadata] endpoint.
For more information, see {url_lip_40}[LIP 40^].
Each module has a set of `stores` and each store has a unique `key`.
After invoking the aforementioned endpoint, search for the `"stores"` property of the `interoperability` module.

Then, look for the {url_lip_45}[outbox substore^] of the `interoperability` module and note down the value of the `key` property.
The following details have been retrieved by invoking the xref:{url_system_getmetadata}[system_getMetadata] endpoint.

.Example of store info retrieved via the "system_getMetadata" endpoint.

    {
        "key": "83ed0d250000",

                    "minLength": 32,
                    "maxLength": 32,

.Properties required to create "inclusionProofKeys"
[cols="~,~",options="header",stripes="hover"]
|===
|Prefix
|Description

|`MODULE_PREFIX`
| The first 4 bytes of the `key` value is the `MODULE_PREFIX`.
For example, in the above-mentioned snippet, the `MODULE_PREFIX` is: `83ed0d25`.

|`SUBSTORE_PREFIX`
|The last 2 bytes of the `key` value is the `SUBSTORE_PREFIX`.
For example, in the above-mentioned snippet, the `SUBSTORE_PREFIX` is: `0000`.

|`STORE_KEY`
|The `STORE_KEY` is a hexadecimal string, calculated based on the Chain ID of the sidechain.
For example, the Chain ID used in the following example is: `04000001`.
|===

TIP: The `*MODULE_PREFIX+SUBSTORE_PREFIX*` is already available in the system's metadata and it can be found in the response of xref:{url_system_getmetadata}[system_getMetadata].
For the example above, the `*"key": "83ed0d250000"*` is equal to `*MODULE_PREFIX+SUBSTORE_PREFIX*`.

==== Calculating `inclusionProofKeys`
To save inclusion proof of `outboxRoot` for a sidechain on the mainchain on the `outbox` substore, do the following:

.Calculating "inclusionProofKeys"
[source,javascript]
----

// 1. Calculate the MODULE_PREFIX using the Interoperability module.
MODULE_PREFIX = Buffer.from('83ed0d25', 'hex')

// 2. Calculate the SUBSTORE_PREFIX using the Outbox Substore.
SUBSTORE_PREFIX = Buffer.from('0000', 'hex') ()

// 3. Calculate the STORE_KEY using the Chain ID of a sidechain.
STORE_KEY = Buffer.from('04000001', 'hex') ()

// 4. Finally, calculate the inclusionProofKeys as described below:
inclusionProofKeys = Buffer.concat([MODULE_PREFIX, SUBSTORE_PREFIX, cryptography.utils.hash(STORE_KEY)]);
----

Once the `inclusionProofKeys` value(s) is retrieved, it should be added to the `system` configuration available inside the *config.json* file of a node.
To save inclusion proof with every new block we need to pass the following configurations:

	},  
}

=====

The above approach should be used to configure the Chain connector plugin as the plugin requires the inclusion proof of the outbox root of the receiving chain to calculate `outboxRootWitness` in CCU transaction.

== Enabling the Chain Connector plugin
A node operator can perform the following steps to enable the chain connector plugin and turn a node into a relayer node.

=== Creating an encrypted private key
. The first step is to create an encrypted private key. 
A node operator can use a REPL session to call the Lisk cryptography libraries.

. The `encryptedPrivateKey` can be created by calling the `encryptMessageWithPassword` function.
It accepts two arguments: a *private key* of the account which is supposed to be used as a relayer address and a *password*.
+
The account should have sufficient balance so that the encrypted private key can be used for signing and sending the transaction.

=====
Once the configuration is ready, update the *config.json* file of the respective client such as mainchain or sidechain.

=== Register plugin
Once the *config.json* has been updated, it is required to register the plugin with the client.
The process differs for both sidechain and mainchain.

[tabs]
=====
Sidechain::
+
--
On a sidechain, the plugin can be enabled using the `--enable-chain-connector-plugin` flag whilst starting the blockchain client.

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start --enable-chain-connector-plugin --overwrite-config
----

Alternatively, the *plugins.ts* file of the client can be updated to have the following options:

.sidechain_client/src/app/plugins.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { Application } from 'lisk-sdk';
// Import the 'ChainConnectorPlugin'
import { ChainConnectorPlugin } from '@liskhq/lisk-framework-chain-connector-plugin';

export const registerPlugins = (app: Application): void => {
    // Register the ChainConnectorPlugin with the app
    app.registerPlugin(new ChainConnectorPlugin());
};

----

The client must be rebuilt to entertain the changes to the code.

[source,bash]
----
npm run build
----
The client can then be started with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start --overwrite-config
----

--
+
Mainchain::
+
--
On a mainchain, the plugin can be enabled using the `--enable-chain-connector-plugin` flag whilst starting the blockchain client.

[source,bash]
----
lisk-core start --network alphanet --enable-chain-connector-plugin --overwrite-config   
----
--
=====
Since the config of the chain is updated during the process, the node operator must update the existing config with the `--overwrite-config` flag.


=== Result
Once the client is running, the node operators should see the following log messages, depending on the type of node.

[tabs]
=====
Sidechain::
+
--
----
2023-03-17T14:42:30.426Z INFO XYZ.local application 96733 No valid CCU can be generated for the height: 58

2023-03-17T14:42:30.426Z INFO XYZ.local plugin_chainConnector 96899 No valid CCU can be generated for the height: 58
----
--
=====
Since we just set up a relayer node and haven't sent a CCU/CCM, the aforementioned log messages are expected.

The messages suggest that the blockchain doesn't have any finalized block height for which we can create a certificate, or there are no pending CCUs/CCMs to send across the chain.

The relayer node will start relaying CCUs to the receiving chain, once the finalized height is reached.

IMPORTANT: Once the plugin is enabled, it is essential to invoke the xref:{url_chainConnector_authorize}[chainConnector_authorize] endpoint to authorize the signing and sending of CCUs.

A node can also output various *warnings* or *error* messages as log output; the details of which can be seen in the following tables:

.Various log messages and their descriptions
[cols="~,~",options="header",stripes="hover"]
|===
|Log message
|Description
2+^|*Warnings messages*: The following log messages can be considered as warnings and they *don't require restarting a node or plugin* to fix the underlying issue as such messages usually suggest problems with chain registration or `apiClient`.

|`Sending chain is not registered to the receiving chain yet and has no chain data.`
|As the log suggests, the sending chain is not registered yet on the receiving chain but at the same time, all the data related to CCU creation is saved such as `blockheaders`, `aggregateCommits`, events containing CCM creation, proof of `outboxRootWitness` and `validatorsInfo`, etc.
For more information read {url_lip_53}[LIP 53^].

|`No CCU generation is possible as the node is syncing.`
|In this scenario, the node is syncing with the network, hence, it cannot generate a CCU.

|`No attempt to create CCU either due to provided ccuFrequency`
|In this scenario, the data required for CCU creation is saved and only CCU creation is delayed due to the provided `ccuFrequency`.

|`Receiving chain is not registered yet on the sending chain.`
|In this case, the plugin is running fine and saving data for CCU creation, however, it cannot yet create or send CCU as the user has not yet registered the receiving chain on their own chain.
For more information, read {url_lip_43}[LIP 43].

|`CCU cant be created as there are no pending CCMs for the last certificate`
|If no new certificate has been created since the last certificate and no pending CCMs are left then, no CCU can be created and the user needs to wait for the next certificate height on its sending chain.

|`Not able to connect to receivingChainAPIClient. Trying again on next new block.`
|In this case, the plugin will try again on the next new block if the API issue is resolved to create/send a CCU.

|`Error occurred while submitting CCU for the blockHeader at height:`
|The log message suggests that the CCU was created successfully but its submission failed for some reason.
In this case, the user needs to check the error attached to the log to debug further.

|`Error occurred while accessing receivingChainAPIClient but all data is saved on newBlock.`
|This error occurs when `receivingChainAPIClient` is not working, the user needs to check the `receivingChainAPIClient` or `receivingChain` node if they are working properly or not once they see this error within the logs.
For example, `receivingChainWsURL` or `receivingChainIPCPath` provided by a user could be incorrect.
In this case, all the data is saved required for CCU creation which means when the user fixes `apiClient`, the plugin would still be able to create/send CCUs.

2+^|*Error messages*: The following error-related logs should be fixed by the user and *require a node restart*.
In these cases, the plugin is usually missing the data required to create CCUs, and that usually happens when something goes wrong while saving data on the plugin.
Such errors also occur when the user enables the `config.registrationHeight` or the `height` after the height from where the plugin started looking for certificates.

|`No block header found for the last certified height ${lastCertificate.height}.`
|In this case, the plugin is looking at a different height and when it is unable to find a certificate, it logs out the aforementioned error.

|`No validatorsHash preimage data present for the given validatorsHash`
|As the error suggests, the node is unable to retrieve the `validatorHash` preimage at the given height.

|`No validators data found for the given validatorsHash`
|If the node is unable to find data based on the given `validatorsHash` on the given height, it will log the aforementioned error.

|`No validators data found for the given last certificate height`
|If the node is unable to find data based on the given `last certificate height`, it will log the aforementioned error.
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Possible ways to debug the case when the first CCU is not sent and the user sees the aforementioned errors are described below:

* Reset the node and start syncing from the height before `config.registrationHeight`.
* Try to give a higher value to the `config.registrationHeight` property from where the plugin started storing data correctly, assuming that the chain of trust is maintained.

Sometimes if the node is very busy with syncing over a long period of time, the plugin misses out on storing information from the new block event, which might lead to the aforementioned errors.
This should not usually happen, however, if it does then, the user must re-sync their node.
