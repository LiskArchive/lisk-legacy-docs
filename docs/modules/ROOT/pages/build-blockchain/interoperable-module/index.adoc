====
In this chapter, you'll learn how to:

* [x] Create CCM inside a command
* [x] Execute a CCM inside a cc_command
* [x] Test the implemetation of an interoperable module by running the interop example scripts.
====

If a Lisk app intends to interact with other blockchains in the network, it needs to provide the required cross-chain commands that create and execute the corresponding CCMs.

NOTE: To learn more about the wat how sidechain communicate to each other via CCM, check out the page about xref:{url_understand_interopcommunication}[].

To show how interoperable modules are implemented, we will extend the Hello app with a very simple command, allowing other chains to react to Hello messages.

To keep it simple, the example only implements one reaction type: Likes.

The example can be extended to include more reaction types, like dislikes or replies for Hello messages, if desired.

== Testing interoperable modules

As interaction between two sidechains always involves three chain (sending chain, receiving chain, and mainchain), it is quite complicated to test newly implemented interoperable modules locally.

To simplify the process, the `lisk-sdk` provides useful example scripts that can be easily adjusted to try out new interoperable modules.

=== The `interop` example of the `lisk-sdk` repository

To try out the cross-chain communication of interoperable modules locally, go the the {url_github_sdk_interop}[interop/example] in the `lisk-sdk` repository.
