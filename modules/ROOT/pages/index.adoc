== Mostly Harmless

Please read this carefully.
The current version of the SDK is the alpha release of the Lisk SDK.
We have released the Lisk SDK in its current form in order for us to improve the development experience through community feedback and contributions.

We strongly discourage anyone from using the alpha release of the Lisk SDK for any production-based blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a real mainnet.

Over the course of the SDK’s alpha phase there will be significant changes in the Lisk protocol and implementation, which will eventually bring the accessibility and reliability to a level which is feasible for production-based blockchain applications.

At this time we only recommend the Lisk SDK for proof-of-concept blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a fake testnet.

Be aware that the dummy delegate accounts are insecure, as their secret passphrases are public.
In addition, the convenient creation of a new genesis block is not supported by alpha release of the Lisk SDK.

The only application built using the Lisk SDK currently feasible for production usage is https://github.com/liskhq/lisk-core[Lisk Core], the client of the Lisk network itself.

Please be advised that we cannot guarantee blockchains created with the alpha release of the Lisk SDK will remain compatible with our planned (beta/rc) releases.

We hope you enjoy building your proof-of-concept blockchain applications using the Lisk SDK and look forward to receiving your feedback and contributions during the alpha phase.

== What is the Lisk SDK?

The Lisk SDK aims to provide an easy and reliable software development kit for building blockchain applications compatible with the xref:1.1@lisk-protocol::index.adoc[Lisk Protocol].

The architecture of the Lisk SDK has been designed so that it can be extended to meet the requirements of a wide variety of blockchain use cases.

The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript, which means for a majority of developers, no significant change of tools is required to get started.

The Lisk SDK makes every effort to allow developers to focus simply and purely on writing the code that matters to their own blockchain application, and nothing more.

=== SDK components

[width="100%",cols="23%,77%",options="header",]
|===
| Directory | Description
| xref:lisk-framework/index.adoc[Framework] | Lisk Framework is an application framework responsible for establishing and maintaining the interactions between the modules of a Lisk blockchain application.

| xref:lisk-elements/index.adoc[Elements] | Lisk Elements is a collection of libraries, each of them implementing some form of blockchain application functionality such as cryptography, transactions, p2p, etc.
Each library is designed to be compatible with the Lisk Protocol.

| xref:lisk-commander/index.adoc[Commander] | Lisk Commander is a command line tool which allows you to manage a Lisk node instance and interact with a Lisk compatible network.
|===

=== Architecture Overview

The Lisk SDK operates on the NodeJS runtime and consists primarily of an application framework (xref:lisk-framework/index.adoc[Lisk Framework]), a collection of libraries providing blockchain application functionalities (xref:lisk-elements/index.adoc[Lisk Elements]), and a powerful Command Line Interface (xref:lisk-commander/index.adoc[Lisk Commander]) which allows developers to manage a Lisk node instance and interact with a Lisk compatible network.

The diagram below provides a high-level overview of the architecture:

== Usage

=== Dependencies

Before running Lisk SDK, the following dependencies need to be installed in order to run applications created with the Lisk SDK:

[options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|NodeJS |10.15.3
|PostgreSQL |10+
|Redis (optional) |5+
|Python |2
|===

You can find further details on installing these dependencies in our xref:setup.adoc[pre-installation setup guide].

Mind, that you need to create a database before.
The default database name is `lisk_dev`, so for the development purposes, a command `createdb lisk_dev` will set you up.
The default database user and password are `lisk` and `password`, they can be both changed in the xref:configuration.adoc[configuration] of Lisk SDK.

=== Installation

The installation of Lisk Alpha SDK is straightforward and limited to getting a single NPM package, `lisk-sdk`, to your Node.js project:

[source,bash]
----
npm install lisk-sdk
----

Lisk SDK is all-in-one package that provides you with tools to create, run and maintain blockchain applications in JavaScript.

In case you only need some specific functionality, it is possible to install only the relevant package, e.g.:

[source,bash]
----
npm install lisk-commmander <1>
npm install lisk-elements <2>
npm install @liskhq/lisk-transactions <3>
npm install @liskhq/lisk-cryptography <4>
----

<1> install Lisk Commander
<2> install Lisk Elements with all packages included
<3> install Lisk Elements Transactions Package
<4> install Lisk Elements Cryptography Package

TIP: Check out the xref:lisk-elements/packages.adoc[full list of Lisk Elements’ packages]

We constantly work on new proof of concept applications that show the features, capabilities and current limitations of the Lisk SDK.

TIP: For concrete examples how to build blockchain applications, check out the xref:tutorials.adoc[Tutorials] page!
Here, we provide detailed step-by-step guides for building the example applications yourself.

=== Lisk SDK Setup

To start, create the project structure of your blockchain application.
Then install the xref:setup.adoc[Lisk SDK dependencies] and the Lisk SDK afterwards.

[source,bash]
----
npm init <1>
npm install lisk-sdk <2>
----

<1> initialize the project by creating a `package.json` file
<2> install the lisk-sdk package as dependency of your project.
Make sure you installed the dependencies of lisk-sdk beforehand.

To create a blockchain application, you need to provide an entry point of your application (like `index.js`) and set-up your network by using the modules of Lisk SDK.

It is quite simple to have a working blockchain application, mirroring the configuration of the existing Lisk network.
This can be done by copying the following three lines of code to your `index.js`:

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); <2>

app.run() <3>
   .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...')) <4>
   .catch(error => { <5>
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(0);
});
----

<1> require the lisk-sdk package.
<2> create a new application with default genesis block for a local devnet.
<3> start the application.
<4> code that is executed after the successful start of the application.
<5> code that is executed if the application start fails.

Now, save and close `index.js` and try to start your newly created blockchain application by running:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short
----

NOTE: `node index.js` will start the node, and `| npx bunyan -o short` will pretty-print the logs in the console.

This should start the application with the predefined defaultconfigurations, which will connect your app to a local devnet.
From this point, you can start to xref:configuration.adoc[configure] and customize the application further.

TIP: For more detailed explanations, check out the xref:tutorials.adoc[example applications], which describe the process of creating a blockchain applications step-by-step.

=== Configure your blockchain parameters

You can also define your blockchain application parameters such as `BLOCK_TIME`, `EPOCH_TIME`, `MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_BLOCK` and more with an optional configurations object.

[source,js]
----
const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, {
    app: {
        label: 'my-blockchain-application',
        minVersion: '0.0.2',
        version: '2.3.4',
        protocolVersion: '4.1',
        genesisConfig: {
            EPOCH_TIME: new Date(Date.UTC(2016, 4, 24, 17, 0, 0, 0)).toISOString(),
            BLOCK_TIME: 10,
            MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_BLOCK: 25,
        },
        ...
});
----

See the xref:configuration.adoc[complete list of configuration options].

=== Register a custom transaction

You can xref:customize.adoc[define your own transaction types] with Lisk-SDK.
This is where the custom logic for your blockchain application lives.

Add your custom transaction type to your blockchain application by registering it to the application instance:

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk');

const MyTransaction = require('./my_transaction'); <1>

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);

app.registerTransaction(MyTransaction); <2>

app
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(0);
    });
----

<1> Require the custom transaction.
<2> Register the custom transaction with the application.

TIP: For information on creating your own custom transaction, see the xref:customize.adoc[customize] page or xref:tutorials.adoc[follow the tutorials].

== How to interact with the network

While your network is up and running, interact with it and the node through the API and use xref:lisk-commander/index.adoc[Lisk Commander] or xref:lisk-elements/index.adoc[Lisk Elements] to create sendable transaction objects.

To monitor and explore the network, you may want to set up a monitoring solution like e.g. https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-explorer[Lisk Explorer].

Depending on the level of customization, Lisk Explorer and Lisk Commander may also require customization to prevent other services from failing.

Another simple way to interact with the network is by connecting it to https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-hub[Lisk Hub].
Lisk Hub provides a simple and beautiful user interface to create and manage accounts on the network, and also to interact with the network by sending different types of transactions.

Once your blockchain is finished, and it is possible to send the transactions (and custom transactions), you can create a frontend to allow users to interact and use your blockchain application.
To connect your frontend to your network, we recommend to make use of xref:lisk-elements/packages.adoc[Lisk Elements’ packages] like xref:lisk-elements/packages/api-client.adoc[lisk-api-client].

TIP: Check out the example applications at the xref:tutorials.adoc[tutorials], to see concrete examples how to make first interactions with a blockchain application.

See more options on the xref:{v_core}@lisk-core::getting-started/interact-with-network.adoc[Interact with the network] page.
