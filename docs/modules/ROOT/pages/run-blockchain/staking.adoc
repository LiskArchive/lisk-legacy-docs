====
On this page, you'll learn how to (un-)stake tokens for a validator on a blockchain that uses the Lisk PoS module, like the Lisk Mainnet.

This includes how to:

* [x] Stake tokens
* [x] Un-stake tokens
* [x] Unlock tokens after un-stake
====

== Introduction
Any accounts with sufficient tokens can stake them to increase the <<validator-weight>> of one or multiple validators.

[#locked-tokens]
*Staked tokens are locked* inside the account that is performing the staking.
That means, the tokens used for staking stay in the account of the staker, but while they are used for staking, they cannot be used for any other purposes for example token transfers.
The staked tokens can be un-staked partially or completely again, if the account owner wishes to unlock the tokens.

[#self-stake]
Staking is particularly important for validators because they need to stake a significant number of their own tokens for their validator account.
This is also called *self-staking*.

Apart from self-staking, Lisk also incentivizes its users to stake their tokens for a different validator as well.
Staking for the most trustful and helpful validators in the community increases the decentralization and security of the network.
It also allows stakers to earn rewards as a lot of validators reward stakers with a share of their block rewards. 
This creates a financial incentive for users to stake their unused tokens and receive regular payouts as a reward.

=== Validator weight

Every validator has an associated *validator weight*.
A high validator weight will put a validator in an active position to generate new blocks for the blockchain.

IMPORTANT: The *minimum validator weight required* to be selected as a block generator is 1000 LSK in the Lisk Mainnet.

Formally, the validator weight is defined as the following:

.Formula for calculating the validator weight
----
validatorWeight = minimum { 10 * selfStake , totalStakeReceived },
----

* `selfStake` is the number of tokens the validator staked for themselves.
* `totalStakeReceived` is the sum of all staked tokens (including self-stakes) for a specific validator.

NOTE: This definition implies that *at least 10% of the validator weight always consist of self-stakes*.

==== How to retrieve the current weight of a validator

To verify the concrete weight of your or any other validator, it is possible to directly request the required information via the RPC endpoint.

. xref:{url_run_validator_details}[Check the validator details]
. Use the values `totalStakeReceived` and `selfStake` to calculate the validator weight, following the formula described above.

:sectnums:

== Checking the current stakes of an account

To retrieve the current stakes of an account, query the `pos_getValidator` endpoint.

The endpoint expects a single parameter:

* `address`: The address of the account

[source,bash]
----
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:7887/rpc' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "pos_getValidator",
    "params": {
         "address": "lskrkhrkm25u5vqxayy3nu9ommt693vwrb546vefj"
    }
}'
----

The response will summarize all stakes that the account specified in the `address` parameter made.

This includes

. a list of the validators that the account staked for, including the validator address and the amount of tokens used for the stake.
. a list of <<checking-for-pending-tokens-ready-to-be-unlocked,pending tokens>>, ready to be <<unlocking-tokens-after-un-stake, unlocked>>.

    }
}

== Staking

Create a transaction to stake tokens for one or multiple validators.

* Up to *20 stakes and/or un-stakes* can be included in a single Stake transaction.
* Staking must be done in a *multiple of 10 LSK*.

The following parameter is required:

* `stakes`: An array of items with the following two properties:
** `amount`: Number of tokens to stake or un-stake.
** `validatorAddress`: The address of the validator to (un-)stake the tokens to.

=== Create a Stake transaction

There are various services and tools to stake tokens, for example: {url_lisk_wallet}[Lisk Desktop^], xref:{url_sdk_elements}[Lisk Elements], or the node CLI.

In the following examples, the node CLI is used to create and send the respective Stake transaction.

== Un-staking

The process of removing staked tokens for a validator account is called *un-staking*.

The un-staking process works analog to the <<staking>> process:
You send a Stake transaction to perform an un-stake.
The only difference is, that you define a *negative* amount of tokens in the Stake transaction, instead of a positive amount.

TIP: It is possible to perform stakes and un-stakes for validators in a single Stake transaction (maximum 20 (un-)stakes per transaction).

Next, send the transaction like described in <<send-the-stake-transaction>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please be aware, that the un-staked tokens will be *locked*.
That means, that the un-staked tokens won't be freely usable directly after they are un-staked.

Please read the next section <<unlocking-tokens-after-un-stake>> for more information.
====

== Unlocking tokens after un-stake

In case you un-staked tokens from one or multiple validators and wish to be able to freely use the tokens for other purposes than staking, it is required to unlock the tokens.

The Unlock transaction will unlock all tokens which are *pending*, i.e. currently locked in the account, without being used for staking.

=== Checking for pending tokens ready to be unlocked

If you wish to check the `amount` of tokens that are ready to be unlocked in an account, query the `pos_getPendingUnlocks` RPC endpoint:

//TODO: Verify Lisk Core command

This will return the total amount of pending tokens:

      "unstakeHeight": 348,
      "unlockable": false,
      "expectedUnlockableHeight": 26348
    }
  ]
}
-----

* `validatorAddress`: The address of the validator from whom the tokens got unstaked.
* `amount`: Number of unstaked tokens.
* `unstakeHeight`: Height of the unstake.
* `unlockable`: `true` if tokens can be unlocked, `false` if not.
* `expectedUnlockableHeight`: Lowest block height in the network for a successful Unlock transaction.


=== Create the Unlock transaction

[CAUTION]
====
Wait to send an Unlock transaction, until the unlockable block height is reached in the network.
If you send the transaction too early, the token unlock will fail.

To verify, if tokens are ready to be unlocked, check the `unlockable` property in the <<checking-for-pending-tokens-ready-to-be-unlocked,pending token status>>.
