On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] How to create a multi-signature user account that is managed by multiple users
* [x] How to create and sign multi-signature transactions
====

== Intro
Multi-signature accounts are user accounts which are managed by a group of users.

As the name suggests, multi-signature accounts need multiple signatures of different members of the multi-signature group to send any transaction.

How many and which members exactly need to sign a transaction is defined during the <<how-to-create-a-multi-signature-account,registration>> of the multi-signature account.

NOTE: A multi-signature account can have 2-64 members.

== Use cases for multi-signature accounts
The uses for multi-signature accounts are numerous and the below examples are only a small selection of the potential possibilities.

=== Escrow Transactions
In case two users get into a dispute, a multi-signature account could be created to solve it.

For example, Alice makes the payment but Bob does not provide the services or goods as promised.
In such a scenario, to resolve the dispute between users, a mutually trusted third party/arbiter steps in.

Considering the wallet is configured to be a 2-of-3 multi-sig wallet, the third key in the above case is given to the arbiter.
Based on the arbiter’s judgment the funds can be given either to Alice or to Bob.

=== Joint Account
A 1-out-of-2 account with no mandatory key can be shared by partners.
Each has a key allowing them to spend the tokens in the account.
In this way, it is clear who has signed which transaction.


=== Community Accounts
An account with 1 mandatory signature and 1 optional out-of-N could be used by a social club.
The account would require the signature of the accountant and one other member.
This way the accountant approves every transaction, which in turn allows them to keep an eye on all the club's expenditures.
Additionally, each transaction is also signed by one member of the club, prohibiting the accountant from stealing any of the funds.

=== Validator pools
Another use case is of "validator pools".
Securing enough self-votes to be an active validator might be easier to achieve for a group than for a single individual.
Users could combine their tokens in a multi-signature account in order to reach the required self-stake to be an active validator in the network.

For example, three people could each participate in a multi-signature account with three mandatory keys and register this account as a validator.
Now the block generating node can safely be operated by any of the participants without risk of losing any funds.

This way, no single individual controls the account.
Instead, the account is controlled together by the members of the multi-signature group.
Therefore, a single person can't issue any transactions for the validator, like staking, changing the commission, or transferring tokens as they would require the authorization of other members of the group.

=== Two-Factor Authentication
If Alice creates a multi-sig wallet that requires two keys, Alice creates a two-factor authentication mechanism to access the funds.
Alice can store the private keys on two different devices and the funds stored in Alice’s multi-signature account can be accessed only if both the keys are provided.

CAUTION: However, using multi-signature as two-factor authentication can be risky, especially if it is a set of 2-of-2 multi-sig addresses.
If one of the keys is lost, you will not be able to access your funds.
Thus, it is safer to use a 2-of-3 setup.

=== Decision Uniformity
A possible use case for multi-signature might be a family account, where family members manage the funds in the account collaboratively.
Or consider a corporation with a board of four directors.
Each board member gains access to one private key.
No individual member can misuse the funds.
Thus, only the decisions agreed upon by majority members can be executed.

== How to create a multi-signature account

//TODO: Add link to typedocs Register multisig command once available
//A multi-signature account is created by sending a {}[Register Multisignature] transaction.
A multi-signature account is created by sending a "Register Multisignature" transaction.
This transaction has to be sent from the account that is supposed to be converted.

NOTE: Multi-signature Registration Transactions from multi-signature accounts are *invalid*.

[#parameters]
The following parameters are required to send a "Register Multisignature" transaction:

. `numberOfSignatures`: The number of private keys that must sign a transaction.
. `mandatoryKeys`: An array of public keys in lexicographical order.
Once the account is registered as a multi-signature account, every outgoing transaction requires a signature for every public key in `mandatoryKeys`.
. `optionalKeys`: An array of public keys in lexicographical order.
Once the account is registered as a multi-signature account, every outgoing transaction requires some signatures for some public keys in `optionalKeys` (the number of needed signatures depends on the `numberOfSignatures` property and may also be zero).
. `signatures`: An array of signatures, corresponding to the public keys contained in `mandatoryKeys` and `optionalKeys`.
All public keys must have a corresponding signature.
The signatures corresponding to `mandatoryKeys` are appended first, followed by those corresponding to `optionalKeys`, where the order of signatures is the same as the order of public keys in the respective array.

Considering the use case example <<escrow-transactions>> from above, the multi-signature registration parameters would look like this:

. `numberOfSignatures`: 2
. `mandatoryKeys`: []
. `optionalKeys`: [AliceKey, BobKey, ArbiterKey]
. `signatures`: [AliceSignature, BobSignature, ArbiterSignature]

=== Pick an account to become multi-signature
Please be aware that the address of the multi-signature account is the same as the one before the multi-signature registration.
Depending on the use case, you might want to turn one of your existing accounts into a multi-signature account or create a new account that will be used as a multi-signature account.

IMPORTANT: If you create a *new account*, don't forget to send over *sufficient tokens* to send the multi-signature registration.

Following our example in the <<parameters, parameters>> section, we need three different account credentials to register the multi-signature account.
Each account will be used to sign the registerMultiSignature transaction individually.
The first account among the three will also be used to send the `registerMultisignature` transaction.

Create three accounts, one for each optionalKey and then add them into an {url_accounts}[accounts.json^] file, like this:

[WARNING]
====
The script mentioned in this guide is for *educational purposes only*.

* The goal is to familiarize you with how a multi-signature account can be registered using code.
* When using the script in real life, the script should be altered to ensure privacy protection of private keys.
* A good way to do that would be to take all the private key info as an input by each user, use each `privateKey` to sign data and only store the signed information, so that it can be later used whilst sending the transaction.

--
Click on the "Register multisignature account" button in the top left menu::
+
To convert the current account into a multi-signature account, click on the top-left menu and select kbd:[Register multisignature account].
+
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/01-register.png["Register button",300]


Define required signatures and group members::
+
This will open a new window where it is possible to define all required parameters like the required amount of signatures and the members of the group.
+
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/02-add-keys.png["Add public keys",300]
+
Members are added by pasting their respective public keys and selecting kbd:[Mandatory] or kbd:[Optional] for the specific member.
+
When all parameters are defined, click on the kbd:[Go to confirmation] button to proceed with the next step.

Verify correct parameters and sign::
+
On the confirmation page, it is possible to verify all provided parameters, before the transaction object is created.
+
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/03-verify.png["Verify parameters", 300]
+
If you wish to edit any of the values, click the kbd:[Edit] button.
Otherwise, confirm the correctness of the values by clicking the kbd:[Sign] button.

Share the transaction::
+
After all necessary parameters are defined, it is required that *all* members of the group (this includes *all* mandatory and *all* optional group members) verify the correctness of the transaction by signing it.
+
This is done to ensure that no account is added to a multi-signature group without their consent.
+
The transaction to be signed is provided as a JSON file or can be directly copied to the clipboard.
+

Let's prepare a script that takes the accounts' data and uses it to create and later sign a `registerMultisignature` transaction.

NOTE: The {url_account_registration_script}[register-multiSig-account.js^] script can be found in the {url_multiSig_reg_directory}[register-multi-sig-accounts^] folder.

const RPC_ENDPOINT = 'ws://127.0.0.1:7887/rpc-ws';
(async () => {
    const appClient = await apiClient.createWSClient(RPC_ENDPOINT);
    const chainID = Buffer.from('00000001', 'hex');
----

. Add details such as the sender of the transaction, all the optional keys, and mandatory keys in sorted form.
+
[source,js]
----
    // The account which will be used to send the multiSignature account registration transaction.
    const senderKeyInfo = accounts[0];

    // For this example, we are using three Optional accounts.
    const optionalAccount1 = accounts[0];
    const optionalAccount2 = accounts[1];
    const optionalAccount3 = accounts[2];
    const sortedMandatoryKeys = [];  // Empty mandatory accounts array since we are not using any mandatory account for a multisig account registration in this guide.
    const sortedOptionalKeys = [Buffer.from(optionalAccount1.publicKey, 'hex'), Buffer.from(optionalAccount2.publicKey, 'hex'), Buffer.from(optionalAccount3.publicKey, 'hex')].sort((a, b) => a.compare(b));
----

. Retrieve the `nonce` of the sender account from the xref:{url_getAuthAccount}[auth_getAuthAccount], and create an `unSignedData` object.
+
[source,js]

    const { nonce } = await appClient.invoke('auth_getAuthAccount', {
        address: address.getLisk32AddressFromPublicKey(Buffer.from(senderKeyInfo.publicKey, 'hex')),
    });

    const unSignedData = {
        address: address.getAddressFromLisk32Address(senderKeyInfo.address),
        nonce: BigInt(nonce),
        numberOfSignatures: 2,
        mandatoryKeys: sortedMandatoryKeys,
        optionalKeys: sortedOptionalKeys,
    };
    console.log('Unsigned data -------->', unSignedData);
----
+
. Encode the `unSignedData` as per the `multisigRegMsgSchema` and also define an empty `signatures` array.
+
[source,js]
----    
    // Each multisig account registration data must be encoded with the multisigRegMsgSchema
    const msgBytes = codec.encode(multisigRegMsgSchema, unSignedData);

=== Collecting signatures
How to create and collect the signatures from other members of the multi-sig group.

To share the generated JSON with the multi-signature registration with all group members, the JSON should be shared *off-chain*, e.g. by sending the JSON file to a group member via email.

[NOTE]
====
The same transaction object should be signed by all members consecutively.
Therefore, it is recommended to choose the first member of the group to share the transaction, and as soon as the member has signed the transaction, pass the resulting JSON on to the next member.
====

[tabs]
=====
Lisk Desktop::
+
--
When the member receives the JSON, they can use Lisk Desktop to sign the JSON like so:

. After logging in to your account, click on the kbd:[Sign multisignature] button in the navigation.
+
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/06-sign-multisig.png["Sign button",300]
. This will open a new window where you are able to paste the JSON you received.
+
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/07-add-json.png["Add JSON",200]
. On the next page, you have the opportunity to review the respective parameters for the multi-signature registration.
+
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/08-review-params.png["Confirmation",200]
+
Double-check that all values are set correctly, before signing the transaction in the next step.
+
If you spot anything that should be changed in the transaction, or if you want to reject it entirely, simply click the kbd:[Reject] button and communicate your reason to the person who shared the JSON with you, if needed.
+
If all values are correct, proceed to sign the transaction by clicking the kbd:[Sign] button.
+
. As a result, you will receive the new JSON which has your signature appended.
+
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/09-share.png["Share",200]

Now either send the JSON back to the person who shared the JSON with you, or forward it directly to one of the remaining group members, whose signature is still missing.

== How to create a multi-signature transaction

This section describes how to create a transaction for a multi-signature account.

The transaction creation is basically analog to normal transactions.

One difference is, that for multi-sig transactions, it will not be possible to send the created transaction right away.
First, all required signatures need to be collected, as explained in <<how-to-sign-a-multi-signature-transaction>>.
That is why you want the transaction to be returned in JSON format in most cases, so all data to be signed is human-readable and can be reviewed and verified by the respective group members.

For Lisk Desktop, it is important to note that the transaction object can only be created from the multi-signature account itself (not its other members).

[tabs]
=====
Lisk Desktop::
+
--
In Lisk Desktop, it is only possible to create a multi-signature transaction by the account owner of the multi-sig account, i.e. the person owning the passphrase/private key of the account.
Only when you log in to the original multi-sig account, it is possible to create the transaction object as described below.

If you are a member of a multi-sig account, but you don't personally have the passphrase for the multi-sig account, it is still possible to create transaction objects for the account, that you can sign and share with other group members.
For this, please refer to the examples in the "Node CLI" and "Lisk SDK" tabs.

Prepare a transaction, for example, a token transfer::
From Lisk Desktop, click on the kbd:[Send] button as you would normally to create a token transfer.
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/14-create-tx.png[]

Confirm the transaction parameters::
Please note it is not immediately possible to send the transaction.
First, the required signatures need to be collected.
In this case, the minimum required signatures are two, which is also displayed in the transaction details.
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/15-review.png[]

Download and share the transaction object::
Sign the transaction object.
In this example, three external accounts manage the multi-sig account, so it will only create the JSON with placeholders for the signatures, which can then be shared with the group members in order to add the required signatures.
If the multi-sig-account itself is a member of the group, one signature will be appended under signatures, and additionally, there will be two placeholders for the remaining signatures of other members.

Node CLI::

Create a transaction via the CLI, and add the `--no-signature` and the `--sender-public-key` flag.
A multi-signature transaction requires individual signatures from the owners of the multi-signature account, hence whilst creating such a transaction, the aforementioned flags should be used.

Lisk SDK::

To create a multi-signature transaction an unsigned transaction object is created first without any signatures, similar to how it is done with the CLI.
Then, the transaction is signed individually by the required signatories and later it can be sent to the node for execution.
A sample script is available in the lisk-sdk-examples repository where a token transfer transaction is first created and signed by a signatory.
This signed transaction can be then passed to the other signatory and a different private key can be used to sign the transaction again.
To create a transaction, do the following steps:

. Create an `accounts.json` file and add the following accounts into it.
The accounts are the same ones that we have used earlier in the registration of a multi-signature account.

== How to sign a multi-signature transaction
As the name suggests, a multi-signature transaction requires signatures from multiple accounts to be valid.

Therefore, it is necessary that the group collects all necessary signatures offline, for example by sharing the respective transaction object as JSON with all members.
They can then consecutively add their signatures if they approve the transaction.

Once the required signatures are reached for a transaction, it is possible to send it to the network, like a normal transaction.

[tabs]
=====
Lisk Desktop::
+
--
Import the transaction::
In Lisk Desktop, click on the kbd:[Sign multisignature] button in the left menu.
This will open a new window, where it is possible to paste the JSON of the multi-sig transaction that the account intends to sign.
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/16-import-tx.png[]

Confirm the transaction parameters::
Review the parameters of the transaction, and confirm the correctness with your signature by clicking on kbd:[Sign], or reject the transaction by clicking on kbd:[Reject].
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/17-review.png[]

Send the transaction::
When the minimum required signatures for a multi-signature transaction are reached, it is possible to directly post the transaction by hitting the kbd:[Send] button.
Otherwise, you can download the new JSON with your signature appended, and pass it to the next member of the multi-signature group.
image:integrate-blockchain/multisig/18-send.png[]
+
When the transaction is accepted, the following confirmation message will be displayed.

Node CLI::
+
--
The `transaction:sign` command is used to sign a multi-signature transaction. 
Paste the transaction hash retrieved in the previous step.
Since the multi-signature account set up in this guide requires two signatures, two public keys should be mentioned after the `--optional-keys` flag.

The node will respond with an updated transaction hash string and the same transaction in JSON format as well.
Notice the `signatures` array in the JSON formatted transaction, it contains placeholders for three signatures.
The aforementioned `sign` transaction adds a single signature as per the lexicographical order of the public keys.

. You can simple uncomment the `dryRun()` or the `postTransaction()` function calls in the *create-multiSig-transaction.js* script to dry run the signed transaction or to post it to the node, respectively.
Alternatively, you can also post the transaction to the node by either using the xref:{url_posting_transaction_node}[transaction:send] command or xref:{url_posting_transaction_curl}[txpool_postTransaction] endpoint.
.. Once the transaction is executed, check the account balance of the sender (the multi-signature account) and the receiver.
The balance of both accounts should have changed.
