How to conveniently interact with a blockchain application during development, by using the dashboard plugin.
// xref:{url_references_dashboard_plugin}[].

.Prerequisites
[NOTE]
====
To use this guide, it is assumed that the following criteria have been met:

. Lisk Commander is installed, and a basic blockchain application is already initialized, as explained in the guide xref:{url_guides_setup}[].
. A new module `HelloModule` is created, as explained in the guide xref:{url_guides_module}[].
. A new asset `HelloAsset` is created, as explained in the guide xref:{url_guides_asset}[].
. A new plugin `LatestHelloPlugin` is created, as explained in the guide xref:{url_guides_plugin}[].
====

== Plugin registration

Install the dashboard plugin:

[source,bash]
----
npm i @liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin
----

Now open `plugins.ts`, import the Dashboard plugin, and register it with the application as shown below:

.src/app/plugins.ts
[source,typescript]
----
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-empty-function */
import { Application } from 'lisk-sdk';
import { LatestHelloPlugin } from "./plugins/latest_hello/latest_hello_plugin";
import { DashboardPlugin } from "@liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin";

// @ts-expect-error Unused variable error happens here until at least one module is registered
export const registerPlugins = (app: Application): void => {

    app.registerPlugin(LatestHelloPlugin);
    app.registerPlugin(DashboardPlugin);
};
----

Save and close `plugins.ts` and start the blockchain application again:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start
----

Wait until the application start has been completed.
Now it is possible to access the dashboard on the browser under `localhost: 4005`

[IMPORTANT]

====
If the WS API hasn't been configured in the config as described in the xref:{url_guides_config_hello}[Config guide], it is also possible to enable the WS API via the following flags:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start --api-ws
----
====

== Dashboard walkabout

Go to http://localhost:4005 to access the dashboard.

.Dashbobard overview

//=== Creating new accounts

=== Subscribing to events

At the bottom of the dashboard is the "Recent events" window, which allows the possibility to subscribe to various events by selecting them from a dropdown box.

It is now possible to subscribe to the newly created event `hello:newHello`

image:guides/dashboard/subscribe_event.png[]

Once a new hello transaction is posted, the event is published and will show up in the window "Recent events".

NOTE: It can happen that the same event is received multiple times, as shown in the example below where the `hello:newHello` was received 3 times.

image:guides/dashboard/receive_newHello_event.png[]

=== Sending transactions

An additional very useful component of the Dashboard is the "Send transaction" section.

The transaction type is selected from the dropdown box.
It is now possible to try out the newly created hello asset from the guide xref:{url_guides_asset}[]: `hello:createHello`.

image::guides/dashboard/send_tx_dropdown.png["Transaction dropdown",400]

Once the desired transaction type is selected, provide the passphrase of the sender account and the hello transaction asset as described below:

The passphrase is retrieved from the file `accounts.json`, which contains the account credentials of all genesis delegates of the hello world blockchain application.

NOTE: The accounts in your `accounts.json` file will be different, because the file was newly created before in the guide xref:{url_guides_genesisblock}[].

.config/accounts.json
[source,js]

	},

Once all the necessary parameters are provided, click on the kbd:[Submit] button.

If the transaction was successfully accepted, you will see the following confirmation:

image::guides/dashboard/send_tx_success2.png[]

To verify that the hello message was updated in the sender account, select the action `app:getAccount` from the section "Call action".

The action `app:getAccount` is part of the xref:{advanced_rpc_appactions}[application actions] and returns the account data for the account address that is specified in the action input.

Provide the address which is belonging to the passphrase that was used to create the hello transaction in the action input field, and click on the kbd:[Submit] button.

image::guides/dashboard/call_action.png["Invoke get account",400]

In the response, it can be seen that the hello message of the account was updated successfully.

image::guides/dashboard/call_action_success2.png["Get account action success",400]

=== Invoking actions

Actions are invoked in the "Call action" section.

In the previous guides the following two new actions were created:

. The action `hello:amountOfHellos` of the xref:{url_guides_module_actions}[hello module]
. The action `latestHello:getLatestHello` of the xref:{url_guides_plugin_actions}[latest hello plugin]

==== Invoking `hello:amountOfHellos`

Select `hello:amountOfHellos` from the dropdown menu.

You can directly click on the kbd:[Submit] button to view the results.
It is not necessary to provide any input, because the action doesn't require any.

image::guides/dashboard/call_moduleaction.png["Invoke module action",400]

As two hello transactions were already sent, the action responds as shown in the illustration below:

image::guides/dashboard/call_moduleaction_success.png["Module action success",400]

==== Invoking `latestHello:getLatestHello`

Select `latestHello:getLatestHello` from the dropdown menu.

You can directly click on the kbd:[Submit] button to view the results.
Again, it is not necessary to provide any input, because the action doesn't require any.

image::guides/dashboard/call_pluginaction.png["Invoke plugin action",400]

As expected, the plugin responds with the latest hello message that was posted to the blockchain application.

image::guides/dashboard/call_pluginaction_success.png["Plugin action success",400]

The Dashboard plugin provides more features, and most of them are very self-explanatory.
For example, you can create new accounts, see all incoming transactions and forged blocks, or see general node and network information.
