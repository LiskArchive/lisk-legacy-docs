== Intro
Multi-signature accounts are user accounts which are managed by a group of users.

As the name suggests, multi-signature accounts need multiple signatures of different members of the multi-signature account to send any transaction.

How many and which members exactly need to sign is defined during the registration of the multi-signature account.

NOTE: A multi-signature account can have 2-64 members.
