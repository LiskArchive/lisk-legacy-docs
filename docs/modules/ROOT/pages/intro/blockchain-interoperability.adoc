== Overview

Interoperability can simply be defined as set of techniques that enable different blockchains to communicate, and transfer digital assets between each other.
As each blockchain has been designed to operate on a different set of rules, having the possibility of connecting or performing transactions between them opens up a myriad of possibilities.
For example, these consist of such invaluable use cases as being able to transfer one type of crypto currency from one completely different blockchain to another, and also allowing the trading of an asset on one chain for a different asset on another chain.

== What is interoperability in blockchain?

Blockchain interoperability can be characterized by having the capability to freely, efficiently, and securely exchange data and information with other blockchains.
As we have previously learned, every transaction performed and every asset held is recorded on a specific blockchain.
With interoperability, all of these actions occurring on blockchain ‘A’ can then be represented on blockchain ‘B’.
This will prove enormously beneficial in the future and will open up the possibility for many new and diverse use-cases to come to fruition.

The goal of blockchain interoperability will result in the seamless transmission of data across different chains.
This data will contain information related to the state of a blockchain that can be reproduced in a secure and efficient manner on a completely different blockchain.
This can be particularly useful when transferring an asset, for example, a crypto asset, such as Lisk, Ethereum, or Cardano.
So with an interoperability solution, an asset or token that is transferred from one chain to another cannot be double-spent when performing the transfer, as it will remain locked on the originating blockchain in the case whereby it is used on the receiving chain.
Naturally, as public interoperability solutions are built with decentralization in mind, this will enable a connection of blockchains to have access to the relevant information from each other without any limits or compromise on decentralization.
Ultimately this will result in connected blockchain ecosystems becoming the norm, as opposed to silo-based blockchain ecosystems.

== Benefits of interoperability

The beauty of blockchain Interoperability will result in eliminating the necessity for third parties or intermediaries that are interconnected with centralized systems.
This will result in further benefiting the future development of decentralized networks once the ability to communicate seamlessly between many different blockchains exist.

- Advantages

A vast improvement in efficiency can be realised by allowing different blockchain networks to interact.
This will result in both faster and more secure transactions, and offer the possibility to utilize additional complex smart contract based applications.

Interoperability will result in a more connected and extensive blockchain ecosystem, ultimately leading to a wider range of use cases.

Seamless transfer of data and assets can be realized between different blockchains, specifically within the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) arena.

Having access to multiple blockchains would offer a wider range of capabilities and features, which could assist developers in building more advanced and innovative applications.


- Disadvantages

The adoption of interoperability could result in security concerns as vulnerabilities in one single blockchain have the potential to impact inerconnected blockchains.
Furthermore, smart contract vulnerabilities could propagate throughout interconnected networks.

Cross-chain transactions and asset transfers could raise compliance and regulatory issues.
For example, different jurisdictions may have conflicting regulations.

At present as there is still lack of standardization this could result in incompatibility and fragmentation between different blockchain networks.

With the increased complexity and necessary communication between the interconnected networks, this could lead to performance issues such as reducing the transaction speed and possibly increasing the costs.

With interoperable blockchain networks this could raise privacy concerns as the potential to expose more user data across different blockchains exists which might not be handled correctly.
