On this page, we'll talk about how a validator can enable reward sharing with their stakers and how the shared rewards can be later claimed by the stakers.

== What is reward sharing?

In the Lisk protocol, validators receive rewards for generating blocks.
Rewards are distributed between validators and their stakers as follows: a certain part of the rewards is awarded directly to the validator as a commission.
Each validator chooses the precise percentage of the commission; then, the remaining rewards are shared among the stakers of the validator. Since a validator also self-stakes, they earn rewards along with other stakers, in proportion to their staked amounts.

NOTE: Validators need to self-stake for their accounts and enable generation to become eligible to generate blocks.
As a result, validators receive additional rewards as per their self-stake, just like their other stakers do.
For example, consider an active validator has 0% commission, and at the same time, no other accounts are staking for the validator.
In this case, the validator would still receive 100% of the block rewards.

The reward-sharing mechanism is part of the PoS module. To learn more about how reward sharing works in Lisk Protocol, see {url_lip_70}[LIP 70^].

The commission values can range between *0* and *10000* (both inclusive), corresponding to percentages with two decimal places, which can be obtained by dividing the value by *100*. For example, a commission value of *1000*, corresponds to a *10%* commission.

Initially, after the validator's registration the commission of a validator is initialized with 100%.
Afterward, it can be decreased by submitting a commission change transaction.

NOTE: A validatorâ€™s commission can be decreased at any time, by any value, however, the commission can only be increased by 5% in a single change commission transaction.
The validator has to wait for 28 days until they can increase the commission again.
For more information, see {url_constraints-on-commission-increase}[Constraints on Commission Increase^].

== Prerequisites and Background

* To earn rewards, a *staker* must stake LSKs for an active block-generating validator.
To learn more about staking, see xref:{url_staking_guide}[].

Once you successfully stake for a validator, you can see your stakes by invoking the xref:{url_getStaker}[pos_getStaker] endpoint.
Each time a validator becomes part of the block generation round, there are chances that the validator will be selected to generate an upcoming block. 

To check if the validator is in the list of active validators, look for the validator in the response of xref:{url_chain_getGeneratorList}[chain_getGeneratorList].
If the validator is in the returned list then, soon your validator will be generating a block and as a result will earn rewards.
The estimated rewards for a validator can be checked via the xref:{url_getexpectedvalidatorrewards}[dynamicReward_getExpectedValidatorRewards] endpoint.

== Sharing rewards
// TODO: Change Commission value to 25 in case the following screenshots are updated.
=== Sharing via Lisk Desktop
To share rewards via Lisk Desktop, the validator should be logged in to their account and then perform the following steps:

. Go to *My validator profile*, and click on the edit icon right next to the current `Commission` value:
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/share-reward-00.png["Click on edit commission",300]
+
. Type `25`, in the *Edit Commission* dialog box, and click on the *Confirm* button.
In this example, the validator is set to keep *25%* of the rewards as a commission and share the remaining *75%* with their stakers, hence the value of `25`.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/share-reward-01.png["Edit Commission",300]
+
. Lisk Desktop will display the *Transaction summary* including the existing and new value of commission.
If everything looks correct, click on the *Confirm* button.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/share-reward-02.png["Transaction summary",300]
+
. Finally, enter the password to authenticate the change commission request, and then click on the *Confirm and sign* button.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/share-reward-03.png["Authenticate",300]
. Lisk Desktop will display an *Edit commission successful* message after submitting the request successfully.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/share-reward-04.png["Edit commission successful",300]
. Once the transaction is executed and the block is finalized, the updated commission value will be shown on the *My validator profile*.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/share-reward-05.png["Updated value",300]

=== Sharing via CLI

To share rewards via CLI, an active validator should create a `changeCommission` transaction to update the commission value.

. The validator should execute the following command to initiate the commission change process:
+
[tabs]
=====
Mainchain node::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core transaction:create pos changeCommission 134000 --json --pretty --send
----
--
Sidechain Node::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run transaction:create pos changeCommission 134000 --json --pretty --send
----
--
=====
+
. The *validator* should enter their `passphrase` and the `newCommission` value. 
In this example, the validator is set to keep *85%* of the rewards and share *15%* with their stakers, hence the value of `8500`.
+
---- 
? Please enter passphrase:  [hidden]
? Please enter: newCommission:  8500
---- 
+
. The `changeCommission` command will return the transaction in the HEX string and JSON format.
It will also post the transaction to the node since we used the `--send` flag earlier.
+

== Claiming rewards
After each block is generated, both the block generator and the staker(s) supporting them will earn a set percentage of rewards.

The part of rewards that is attributed to the validator that generated the block is automatically assigned to them by the Lisk Protocol.
This is done by incrementing the `availableBalance` of the validator's account by the amount of rewards corresponding to the commission and self-stake.

On the other hand, stakers need to manually claim their rewards, and that can be done via both Lisk Desktop and CLI.
The part of rewards belonging to stakers, gets locked in the validator's account, by the PoS module, (by increasing its `lockedBalance`) until each staker claims their rewards.

For more information, see {url_reward_distribution}[Distribution of Rewards^].

=== Claiming via Desktop
To claim rewards via Lisk Desktop, a staker must log in to their account on Lisk Desktop and perform the following steps to collect earned rewards:

. As soon as the staker earns a reward, they will be notified about it by Lisk Desktop.
The *Claim rewards* option will be available in the pop-up notification and also in the *Stakes* page of the staker's account. 
+
NOTE: You can click directly on the *Claim rewards* option available on the pop-up notification to proceed with claiming rewards.
However, the pop-up notification will disappear after a few moments, and in case you miss clicking on it, you can try claiming rewards via the *Stakes* screen.
+
Click on the *Stakes* button to continue the reward-claiming process.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/claim-rewards-00.png["Claim reward Notification",300]
+
. On the *Stakes* page, click on the *Claim rewards* button.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/claim-rewards-01.png["Click on Claim Rewards",300]
+
. A dialogue box will open where the summary of earned rewards will be shown to the staker, click on the *Claim rewards* button available on the dialogue box.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/claim-rewards-02.png["Claim reward summary",300]
+
. Lisk Desktop will display a *Transaction summary* to the staker.
If everything looks correct, click on the *Confirm* button.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/claim-rewards-03.png["Transaction Summary",300]
+
. Finally, enter the password to authenticate the reward-claiming request, and then click on the *Continue* button.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/claim-rewards-04.png["Claim reward successful",300]
+
. Upon successful request submission, Lisk Desktop will display a *Transaction submitted* successfully message.
+
image:run-blockchain/reward-sharing/claim-rewards-05.png["Updated balance",300]
. Once the transaction is executed, the staker's account balance will increase as per the earned reward, and the corresponding amount will be reduced from the validator's locked balance.

=== Claiming via CLI
To claim rewards via CLI, a staker must perform the following steps to collect earned rewards:

. Check available rewards by invoking the xref:{url_getclaimablerewards}[pos_getClaimableRewards] endpoint by passing the staker's `address`.
+

        }
    ]
