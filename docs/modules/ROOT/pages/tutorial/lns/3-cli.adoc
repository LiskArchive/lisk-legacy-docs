== Extending the application
To further enhance the LNS blockchain application, create two new LNS specific commands which can be executed directly from the command line:

* <<lnsresolve>> Command to resolve a provided domain name to an account address.
* <<lnslookup>>: Command to perform a reverse lookup for a provided account address.
Returns the default domain name of an account.

The application CLI already contains numerous general commands by default.
They are directly created when the application is bootstrapped using Lisk Commander with `lisk init`.

An overview of all existing CLI commands can be seen by navigating to the root folder of the blockchain application, and running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run
----

This will return the command reference for the application CLI:

----

We already used the CLI in this tutorial to start the LNS application.
Now, the plan is to create a new topic `lns`, and to define the two new commands `lns:resolve` and `lns:lookup` to be part of it.

Navigate to `lisk-name-service/lns/commands/` and create a new folder `lns`, which will contain the files for the new commands.

.lisk-name-service/lns/commands/
[source,bash]
----
mkdir lns
cd lns
----

[TIP]

====
The application CLI commands are based on {url_oclif}[OCLIF^].

Check out their documentation to get a deeper understanding on how the CLI commands are constructed.
====

=== lns:resolve

Create a new file `resolve.ts` and import the `BaseIPCClientCommand` from Lisk Commander.

Create a new class `LNSResolveCommand`, which extends the class {url_sdk_baseipcclient}[BaseIPCClientCommand^] of Lisk Commander.

./lisk-name-service/lns/src/commands/lns/resolve.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { BaseIPCClientCommand } from 'lisk-commander';

export class LNSResolveCommand extends BaseIPCClientCommand {

}
----

The `BaseIPCClientCommand` already contains two optional default flags for the command: `pretty` and `data-path`.
It also contains an API client to the node which will be used to invoke actions in the LNS application via the CLI.

The only method required for a new command is the `.run()` function.

In this particular use case, one argument is needed, the name to resolve.

You may also add some examples about the usage of the command, which will be added to the auto-generated command reference.

./lisk-name-service/lns/src/commands/lns/resolve.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { BaseIPCClientCommand } from 'lisk-commander';

export class LNSResolveCommand extends BaseIPCClientCommand {
    // Available command arguments
	static args = [
		{
			name: 'name',
			required: true,
			description: 'Name to resolve.',
		},
	];

	// Command usage examples
	static examples = ['lns:resolve jhon.lsk', 'lns:resolve jhon.lsk --pretty'];

	// Executed every time the respective command is executed in the CLI.
	public async run(): Promise<void> {
	    // Parses the provided command arguments
		const { args } = this.parse(LNSResolveCommand);
		// Get the name argument from the arguments object
		const { name } = args as { name: string };

		// Invoke the action 'lns:resolveName' on the node via the API client.
		const result = await this._client?.invoke('lns:resolveName', { name });

		// If the node returns a result, print it to the console as JSON.
		if (result) {
			return this.printJSON(result);
		}

		// Display this message, if the name couldn't be resolved successfully.
		return this.log(`Can not resolve name "${name}"`);
	}
}
----

This is all the code required to add the new command to the LNS blockchain application.

As can be seen, there is not much logic required to be implemented here.
The action <<actions,lns:resolveName>> can be reused to get the address, based on the address that was provided as the command argument.

=== lns:lookup

Create a new file `lookup.ts` and paste the code snippet below.
This is all the code required to add the `lns:lookup` command to the LNS blockchain application.

The implementation is analog to the previous command, nevertheless, now use the corresponding action `lns:lookup` to get the domain name for the provided account address.

./lisk-name-service/lns/src/commands/lns/lookup.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { BaseIPCClientCommand } from 'lisk-commander';

export class LNSLookupCommand extends BaseIPCClientCommand {
	static args = [
		{
			name: 'address',
			required: true,
			description: 'Address to lookup',
		},
	];

	static examples = ['lns:lookup <hex-address>', 'lns:lookup afe179fa12a988c1244444479c --pretty'];

	public async run(): Promise<void> {
		const { args } = this.parse(LNSLookupCommand);
		const { address } = args as { address: string };

		if (address !== Buffer.from(address, 'hex').toString('hex')) {
			this.error('Invalid address format');
		}

		const result = await this._client?.invoke('lns:lookupAddress', { address });

		if (result) {
			return this.printJSON(result);
		}

		return this.log(`Can not find account with address "${address}"`);
	}
}

== Trying out the new CLI commands

Display the CLI reference once again.
The new topic `lns` should now appear under `TOPICS`:

----

If the LNS application is not already running, start it again:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./bin/run start
----

Now resolve the domain name `my-name.lsk`, which was registered previously.

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run lns:resolve my-name.lsk
----

This will return the corresponding LNS object:

[source,json]
----
{
  "ownerAddress":"39cdb96af23eaf431ef3fb8e5da58d9950c3bc96",
  "name":"my-name.lsk",
  "ttl":4000,
  "expiry":1694173170,
  "createdAt":1631101170,
  "updatedAt":1631105400,
  "records":[{
    "type":2,
    "label":"my-twitter",
    "value":"@followMe"
  }]
}
----

When the resolve command works as expected, copy the `ownerAdress` from the returned LNS object and provide it as an argument for the `lns:lookup` command:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./bin/run lns:lookup 39cdb96af23eaf431ef3fb8e5da58d9950c3bc96
----

This will return the corresponding LNS object:

[source,json]
----
{
  "ownerAddress":"39cdb96af23eaf431ef3fb8e5da58d9950c3bc96",
  "name":"awesome.lsk",
  "ttl":3600,
  "expiry":1662734230,
  "createdAt":1631198230,
  "updatedAt":1631198230,
  "records":[]
}
----

[NOTE]

====
Each account can register multiple domain names to their account.
The address lookup returns a different object for the provided address, because the account has set `awesome.lsk` to be the default domain name for this account.
