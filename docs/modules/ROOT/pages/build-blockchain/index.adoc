The "Build Blockchain" category contains all the guides related to the development of a sidechain client.

== The Hello World sidechain

By the example of the "Hello World" client, it is explained how to build a very simple sidechain client step by step in the following chapters.

NOTE: Although the example is kept very simple by intention, the Hello World client implements and uses all the most important components of a module, and is therefore a good example to understand the basics of module development.

The "Hello World" sidechain allows each account to save a greeting message on-chain.

The following guides each focus on developing a specific part of the Hello application.

. xref:{url_guide_app}[]: How to bootstrap a default sidechain client.
. xref:{url_guide_config}[]: How to create a custom configuration for a sidechain client.
. xref:{url_guide_module}[]: How to create a new module and how to add it to the client.
In the example, the `HelloModule` will contain all on-chain logic related to the Hello message.
. xref:{url_guide_command}[]: How to create a new command and how to add it to a module.
In the example, the "Create Hello" command saves Hello messages of accounts, if they send a corresponding transaction.
. xref:{url_guide_genesisblock}[]: How to generate a new genesis block for a sidechain.
. xref:{url_guide_plugin}[]: How to create a new plugin and how to add it to the sidechain client.
In the example, the `HelloPlugin` will return the latest Hello message which was sent to the network, and its sender address.
