The {url_docs}[Lisk documentation^] includes explanations, guides, tutorials and references about

* the {url_github_sdk}[Lisk SDK^],
* {url_github_core}[Lisk Core^],
* {url_github_service}[Lisk Service^],
* and the {url_github_lips}[Lisk protocol^] in general

The Lisk documentation uses {url_antora}[Antora^] as a documentation generator.

== Repository structure

The internal structure of `development` and `main` branch.

=== The `docs/` folder

The source content for the general Lisk documentation is located in the `docs/` folder.

The file structure follows the expected structure for Antora documentation, see: {url_antora_directories}[^].

All content is written in AsciiDoc.

=== The `ui/` folder

The presentation of the documentation is stored completely separate from the actual content.

The UI is based on the {url_antora_ui}[Antora default UI^] (see also {url_antora_ui_docs}[^]).

It is customized as listed in the following points below:

* Updated the CSS to improve the UX and follow the Lisk brand styleguide.
* Added additional features, such as:
** Algolia site search
** Dark theme
** Zoom for images
** Additional layout for swagger UI
** Tab-blocks
** ...

=== The `build/` folder
The `build` folder contains the following:

* ...the `site.yml` file, which is used to generate the Lisk documentation using Antora.
* ...the `searchdocs-scraper` folder, for creating the search index.
* ...the `lib` folder which stores the Asciidoc extensions that are used in the Lisk documentation.
