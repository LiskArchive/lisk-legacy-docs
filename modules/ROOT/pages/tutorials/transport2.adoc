= Transport Tutorial Part 2: A simple supply chain tracking system
:toc: preamble
:imagesdir: ../../assets/images
:experimental:
:v_core: master

The goal of Part 2 is to implement a complete workflow of a very simple version of a supply chain tracking system.

You will learn here how to:

* implement the missing transactions types `RegisterPacket`, `StartTransport` and `FinishTransport`
* cache multiple accounts in the `prepare` step
* implement a simple trust system
* lock funds in an account
* do a first complete test-run of the supply chain tracking system

NOTE: To get a good overview about the general workflow we are going to implement, take a look at the xref:tutorials/transport.adoc#_general_procedure[diagram on the Introduction page] of the workshop.

[TIP]
====
"Got more of those... solutions?"::
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/tree/development/transport/transactions/solutions[Yes we have!], check out the fully working implementation of the other transactions in the `transactions/solutions/` folder.

After completing a task, compare with the solutions, to verify if you completed the task successfully.
But be aware, there is not only one valid solution, how to write the code.
In step 2.3 we will try out the actual code, to verify it works as expected.

== 2.0 Implement RegisterPacket

For the next step in our prototype, we need to implement the `RegisterPacket` transaction.
This transaction will register a packet on the blockchain that is ready to be picked up by a delivery person.
The transaction allows the package owner to define a couple of properties:

* `packetId`: The ID of the packet account (registered on Raspberry Pi).
* `postage`: The postage refers to a number of LSK tokens the carrier receives upon successful delivery of the packet.
The postage is stored in the packet account's asset field.
* `security`: The security refers to a number of LSK tokens that the carrier should lock as a "security" before he can accept the packet for delivery.
Upon successful delivery, the security will be unlocked again to the carriers balance.
* `minTrust`: This minimum trust property has been introduced to keep track of well-behaving/performing carriers.
Whenever a carrier successfully delivers a packet, his trust will be increased by one.
The package owner can set a minimal trust level for a carrier before he can accept the package for delivery.
If a carrier has a lower trust than the minimal required trust level, he cannot accept the package for delivery.
* `recipientId`: This is maybe the most important field as it sets the recipient for the package.

For the `RegisterPacketTransaction` we will guide you through the `undoAsset()` function and let you implement a small snippet of code yourself.

=== Task: Complete the implementation of the `undoAsset` function.
You will notice a small part of the logic is missing where we reset the packet account to its original state.

Try to implement the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/transport/transactions/register-packet.js#L160[missing logic] for `undoAsset()` yourself by reverting the steps of the `applyAsset()` function.

**Important: To verify your implementation of `undoAsset()`, compare it with the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/transport/transactions/solutions/register-packet.js[solution].**

=== Explanation: `undoAsset(store)`
The `undoAsset` function is responsible for telling the blockchain how to revert changes that have been applied via the `applyAsset` function.
This is very useful in case of a fork where we have to change to a different chain.
In order to accomplish this, we have to roll back blocks and apply new blocks of a new chain.
This means, when rolling back blocks we have to update the account state of the affected accounts.
That's the reason why you should never skip writing logic for the `undoAsset` function.

== 2.1 Start the Transport
For the next step in our prototype, we need to implement the `StartTransport` transaction.
This transaction indicates the start of the transportation as the carrier picks up the package from the sender.

When creating the `StartTransport` transaction, the carrier defines:

* `packetId`: The ID of the packet that the carrier is going to transport.
The `packetId` is not send in the asset field but is assigned to the `recipientId` property of the transaction.

This transaction will:

* Lock the specified `security` of the packet in the carriers' account.
This security cannot be accessed by the carrier, unless the transport has been finished successfully.
* Add the `carrier` to the packet account.
* Set the `status` of the packet from `pending` to `ongoing`.

For the `StartTransportTransaction` we will guide you through the `prepare()` and `undoAsset()` functions and let you implement the locking of the security in the carrier his account.

=== Task: Lock Funds
Locking funds is actually very straightforward.
First, you deduct the number of tokens you want to lock from the account's balance.

[source,js]
----
const carrierBalanceWithoutSecurity = carrierBalance.sub(packetSecurity);
----

Next, you store the deducted number of tokens in a custom property in the `asset` field.
This ensures, we can later know how much tokens we had locked as a security.

https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/transport/transactions/start-transport.js#L53[Insert your own code here]:
Create an updated object for the carrier account, that substracts the `security` from the carriers balance, and adds a new property `lockedSecurity` to the `asset` field of the carriers account.
The `lockedSecurity` should equal exactly the amount, that you deducted from the carriers `balance`.

NOTE: To unlock locked tokens remove or nullify the custom property in the `asset` field and add the number of tokens again to the account's `balance`.

**Important: To verify your implementation, compare it with the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/transport/transactions/solutions/start-transport.js[solution].**

=== Explanation: `prepare()`
The prepare function here is caching both the carrier account through the `senderId` and the packet account through the `recipientId`.

_Why can we cache two accounts at the same time?_
Notice that the cache function accepts an array which allows to pass in multiple query objects.
When we pass in an array to the cache function, it will try to find a result for each query object.

It is also possible to pass in just one query object without surrounding array.
In this case, only objects that exactly match this query object will be cached.

[source,js]
----
async prepare(store) {
        await store.account.cache([
            {
                address: this.recipientId,
            },
            {
                address: this.senderId,
            }
        ]);
    }

You can find a more detailed explanation in the custom transactions deep dive article which you can find on https://lisk.io/blog/tutorial/custom-transactions-statestore-basetransaction-transfer-transaction#6658[our blog].
The link opens the section `B/ Combining Filters`.

== 2.2 Finish the Transport

The last custom transaction type we need to implement is the `FinishTransportTransaction`, which will complete the transport of the packet.

When reaching the recipient of the packet, the carrier passes the packet to the recipient.
The recipient needs to sign the `FinishTransportTransaction`, that verifies that the packet has been passed on to the recipient.

When sending the transaction, the recipient needs to specify:

* `packetID`: The ID of the packet that the recipient received
* `status`: The status of the transport, which has 2 options: `"success"` or `"fail"`

This transaction will:

* If `status="success"`
** Send `postage` to carrier account
** Unlock `security` in carrier account
** Increase `trust` of carrier +1
** Set packet `status` to `success`
* If `status="fail"`
** Send `postage` to sender account
** Add `security` to the sender account, and nullify `lockedSecurity` from the account fo the carrier.
** Decrease `trust` of carrier by -1
** Set packet `status` to `fail`

=== Explanation: Caching data based on data from the db

Sometimes it might be needed to cache accounts or other data from the database, depending on other data that is stored in the database.

To achieve this:

. cache the data with `store.account.cache`
. save the data as a constant with `store.account.get`
. You can now use the newly created constand to cache the rest of the data, like shown in the code snippet below.

.`prepare()` function of `finish-transport.js`
[source,js]
----
async prepare(store) {
    /**
     * Get packet account
     */
    await store.account.cache([
        {
            address: this.recipientId,
        }
    ]);
    /**
     * Get sender and recipient accounts of the packet
     */
    const pckt = store.account.get(this.recipientId);
    await store.account.cache([
        {
            address: pckt.asset.carrier,
        },
        {
            address: pckt.asset.sender,
        },
    ]);
}
----

=== Task: Implement the logic in `applyAsset()` for a successful transport
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/transport/transactions/finish-transport.js#L83[Write your own logic or the case of a successful transport of the packet here.]

When the recipient receives the packet from the carrier, the recipient would sign and send the `FinishTransportTransaction`.
If the recipient consideres the transport successfull, the carrier should be rewarded accordngly, and the packet status should be updated to `success`.

TIP: Find more information about what exactly to do in the code comments of `finish-transport.js`

**Important: To verify your implementation of `applyAsset()`, compare it with the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/transport/transactions/solutions/finish-transport.js[solution].**

== 2.3 Test out the full workflow with the client app

=== Check for status in the `lightAlarmTransaction`

Now that we implemented the whole workflow with different statuses for the packet, we actually only want to send an alarm, if the status of the packet is `ongoing` or `alarm`.

Insert the snippet below in the `applyAsset()` function of https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/transport/transactions/light-alarm.js#L39[light-alarm.js], before the code that applies the changes to the database accounts.

If the status isn't `ongoing` or `alarm` it will create a new `TransactionError`, push it to the `errors` list, and return it.

IMPORTANT: You have to insert this snippet twice: Once in `transaction/light-alarm.js` on your local machine, and in the `light-alarm.js` on your raspberry pi.h

[source,js]
----
const packet = store.account.get(this.senderId);
if (packet.asset.status !== 'ongoing' && packet.asset.status !== 'alarm') {
    errors.push(
        new TransactionError(
            'Transaction invalid because delivery is not "ongoing".',
            this.id,
            'packet.asset.status',
            packet.asset.status,
            `Expected status to be equal to "ongoing" or "alarm"`,
        )
    );

    return errors;
}
----

=== Register all transaction types with the node app

If you haven't done yet, uncomment now all the custom transactions, to register them with the node application.

[source, js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk');
const RegisterPacketTransaction = require('../transactions/register-packet');
const StartTransportTransaction = require('../transactions/start-transport');
const FinishTransportTransaction = require('../transactions/finish-transport');
const LightAlarmTransaction = require('../transactions/light-alarm');

configDevnet.app.label = 'lisk-transport';
configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.public = true;

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);
app.registerTransaction(RegisterPacketTransaction);
app.registerTransaction(StartTransportTransaction);
app.registerTransaction(FinishTransportTransaction);
app.registerTransaction(LightAlarmTransaction);

app
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });

----

=== Try it out in the client app

Start or restart the `node`, `client` and `iot` application, like you did in xref:tutorials/transport1.adoc#_1_3_the_client_application[Step 1.3 in Part 1] of the workshop.

Go to http://localhost:3000 to access the client app through your web browser.

[TIP]
====
You find prepared account credentials for sender, recipient and carrier in `client/accounts.json`.

These credentials are already prefilled for you in the different forms in the client app.

==== Initialize a new packet account

Go to http://localhost:3000/initialize and copy the packet credentials https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/transport/iot/light_alarm/index.js#L18[in your tracking script] on the Raspberry Pi.

.Create new packet credentials
image:1-initialize.png[Initialize packet account]

==== Register the packet

First, head to the http://localhost:3000/post-register-packet[Register Packet] page and fill out the form to register your packet in the network.

IMPORTANT: Use as packet ID the address of the packet credentials that you created in the previous step.

TIP: Set `minTrust` to `0`, because you don't have any carrier in the system yet, that has more than `0` trustpoints.

.Sender posts the `RegisterPacket` transaction to register the packet on the network
image:2-register.png[register packet]

.Check the `Packet & Carrier` page to see if the packet status is now "pending"
image:3-pending.png[packet pending]

If you open the packet at this point, the light alarm transaction should fail, because the packet has the wrong `status`.
It should display the following error:

[source, js]
----
[
  {
    "message": "Transaction invalid because delivery is not \"ongoing\".",
    "name": "TransactionError",
    "id": "5902807582253136271",
    "dataPath": "packet.asset.status",
    "actual": "pending",
    "expected": "Expected status to be equal to \"ongoing\" or \"alarm\""
  }
]
----

==== Fund the carrier account

Before the transport of the packet starts, we first need to transfer some tokens to the carrier account, which doesn't have any tokens initially.
This is necessary, because the carrier needs to lock the `security` in the carriers account, in order to start the transport.

To do this, go to the http://localhost:3000/faucet[Faucet page] and enter the carrier address(`6795425954908428407L`) and the amount of tokens that shall be transferred to this account.

Just make sure, it's enough so the carrier can afford to lock the `security` of the packet, that was defined in the step before, where you registered the packet in the network.

TIP: You can check on the `Accounts` page, if the carrier received the tokens successfully.

image:4-faucet.png[Fund carrier]

==== Start transport

The carrier needs to post the transaction on the http://localhost:3000/post-start-transport[Start Transport] page, to start the transport.

The only thing the carrier needs to specify here, is the `packetId`.

The transaction will only be accepted, if the carrier has enough `trust` and `security`, for the specified packet.

.Carrier posts the `StartTransport` transaction, and then receives the packet from the sender
image:5-start.png[start transport]

.API response
image:22-register-response.png[finish transport]

.Check the `Packet & Carrier` page to see if the packet status has changed to "ongoing"
image:6-ongoing.png[packet account 2]

IMPORTANT: The light alarm will only go off after posting `StartTransport` and before posting `FinishTransport`, because of the status check that we added in <<_check_for_status_in_the_lightalarmtransaction, Check for status in the lightAlarmTransaction>>

image:7-alarm.png[packet alarm]

==== Finish transport

When the carrier passes the packet to the recipient, the recipient will sign the final http://localhost:3000/post-finish-transport[FinishTransport] transaction, which will complete the transport of the packet.

The only thing the recipient needs to specify here are the `packetId` and the `status`, which can be `fail` or `success`.

To help with the decision of the final status, the recipient can inspect the packet after receiving it.
But that's not all!
Because of the IoT device inside the packet, the recipient can also check in the client app, if the packet triggered any alarm.

NOTE: In case the recipient doesn't receive the packet after a reasonable amount of time, the recipient can and should send the `FinishTransport` transaction, too (most likely with `status=fail`).

.Recipient posts the `FinishTransport` transaction, once he*she received the packet from the carrier
image:8-finish.png[finish transport]

Decide yourself if the transport is successful or not.
Verify the expected changes in the accounts on the `Packet&Carrier` page.

.Transport fail
image:9-fail.png[finish transport fail]

.API response
image:92-success.png[finish transport]

With all of the above steps completed, you have a very simple, but fully working proof of concept of a decentralised supply chain tracking system running on your machine.

IMPORTANT: Time to celebrate! \o/

TIP: Move on to the next section to find additional explanations and possible next steps.

== 2.4 Next steps (optional)

=== 2.4.1 Make it portable

Currently the packet is not really portable, because it is connected via USB to your machine in order to get power.

To make it portable, all you need is a portable power source, like a battery, that provides the Raspberry Pi with enough power to track the packet for at least a few hours.

The second thing that needs to be done is making the tracking script start automatically after the boot process of the Pi.

`pm2` provides an easy way to let your script start automatically after boot.
On your Raspberry Pi, install `pm2` globally:

[source, bash]
----
npm install pm2 -g
pm2 startup
----

This should print a fitting command for you in the terminal.
Copy it and paste it in the temrinal again to complete the setup of the `pm2` startup script.

Start your tracking script with `pm2`:

.Run this inside the `light_alarm` folder on the Raspberry Pi
[source, bash]
----
pm2 start --name lightAlarm index.js
----

.Add the tracking script to the list of processes, that will be started autmatically when the raspberry pi is started.
[source, bash]
----
pm2 save
----

Now log out from your Raspberry Pi, disconnect it from your machine, and connect it to a portable energy source, like a power bank.
After 1-2 minutes of booting, the tracking script will start running and it will check the light sensor every second.

=== 2.4.2 Connect more nodes

During development it is necessary and convenient to have a rather centralized network with only one node connected.

Once the development has reached the point of proof of concept or a usable product, it's time to add more nodes to the network, and to give other people the opportunity to join the newly created blockchain network.

This is how the setup looks right now:

image:1-node.png[One node diagram]

We want to add one more node to the network, that communicates between the seed node and the Iot and the client app.

image:2-nodes.png[More nodes diagram]

To do so:

==== A) Set up at least one seed node

Set up one or multiple seed node(s).
Every new node will connect to the seed nodes at first, when booting for the first time.
Starting from the seed node, a new node will discover the rest of the network by requesting their peer list and then the peer lists of the newly discovered peers and so on.

The seed node is a node that is specified in the config of the node application under `modules.network.seedPeers` and that should always stay connected to the network.

It's also convenient to have the genesis delegates actively forging on the seed node, in case the network hasn't yet enough real delegates who can take the forging spots.

TIP: The exposed `configDevnet` object is a good template for the config of a seed node, as it includes already all 101 genesis delegates credentials and automatically enables forging for all of them.

==== B) Create a new config suited for your node application

Exchange the `configDevnet` object that we passed to our node during development with your own customized version.

[TIP]
====
It's recommended to create a config object with all the options that you want different from the default config options.
To check the default config options, go to the xref:configuration.adoc[configuration page] or check it out directly in the code: +
`lisk-framework/src/modules/MODULE_NAME/defaults/config.js`. +
Same goes for the components: +
`lisk-framework/src/components/COMPONENT_NAME/defaults/config.js`.
====

Most of the configurations can stay the same to what is defined in the default config options, but there is one option that you should update: **The seed node(s)**.

So to add `1.2.3.4` as a seed node, add an object (or several objects) with the 2 properties `ip` and `wsPort` to the `seedPeers` list:

[source, js]
----
configDevnet.modules.network.seedPeers = [{ ip: '1.2.3.4', wsPort: 5000}]
----

[NOTE]
====
No forging delegates are set in the default values. +
This is intended, because the genesis delegates are only needed to set up a working dev environment.
Later, you want the `delegates` list to be empty, so users can fill their own credentials there, in case they want to activate forging on their node.

If you wish, e.g. for a proof of concept, to provide already activated forging delegates inside the config, use the devnet genesis delegates in https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk/blob/development/sdk/src/samples/config_devnet.json[configDevnet] or create your own genesis delegates and add them to the config.
====

==== C) Publish application

Add the code for your customized `node` application (including the custom transaction types) to a public code repository on e.g. Github or Gitlab.

This gives everyone the opportunity to download the application and deploy it on a server in order to connect with the network.

==== D) Connect nodes and verify

Let's now add a second node to the network.

This new node will not have any forging activated.
It will be only here to talk via API with the `client` app, and over the websocket connection to the seed node.
The seed node is therefore the only node right now that can forge new blocks, because all genesis delegates are active only on the seed peer.

TIP: How to replace the genesis delegates with real delegates is covered in the next section <<_2_3_4_replace_dummy_delegates_with_real_ones, Replace dummy delegates with real ones>>.

To set up the node, just install the published application on a new server.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to open the corresponding xref:configuration.adoc#_ports[ports] for HTTP and WS communication!

.Snippet of client/app.js
[source,js]
----
// Constants
const API_BASEURL = 'http://134.209.234.204:4000'; <1>
const PORT = 3000;
----

<1> Add here the correct IP and port to the newly added node.

.Logs of newly added node
image:synching_node.png[Synching non forging node]

In the logs above we can see, the seed node was already 3 blocks ahead when we first started the second node.
It first synchronizes the missing blocks up to the current height and then broadcasts the received transactions from the client app to the seed peer, where delegates can add the transactions to blocks and forge them.

These new blocks are broadcasted again to the new node, and the client app can display the data based on the API calls that it sends to the new node.

.Log of the seed node with the forging genesis delegates
image:forging_node.png[Forging node logs]

[NOTE]
.Broadcast errors can happen
====
Sometimes there can be errors when broadcasting transactions between nodes.
This is no need to worry!
The node will start the sync process soon again, and most times it is successfull on the next try.
====

.If you see this, don't worry!

=== 2.4.5 Task: Add more sensors

Connect more sensors to secure the travel of the packet, e.g. implement a `TemperatureAlarm` or `HumidityAlarm` analog to the `LightAlarm` transaction type.
