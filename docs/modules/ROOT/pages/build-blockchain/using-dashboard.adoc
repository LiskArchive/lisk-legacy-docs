The {url_references_dashboard_plugin}[Dashboard plugin^] offers various features that facilitate interaction with a Lisk application.
The Dashboard can be registered with any Lisk Application.

For this guide, the Dashboard plugin is registered to the xref:{url_guides_setup}[Hello World application], though the steps mentioned below can be applied to any Lisk-based blockchain client.

====
On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] Registration of the Dashboard plugin to a blockchain client.
* [x] Interacting with a node via the Dashboard plugin such as invoking commands, endpoints and subscribing to events, etc.
====

== Plugin registration

With Lisk v6, the default plugins come pre-installed after an application is initiated.
You can check the `package.json` file of the blockchain client to ensure the installation.

.hello_client/package.json
[source,json]
----
"dependencies": {
	"@liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin": "0.2.0",
	//[...]
},
----

Otherwise, you can install the Dashboard plugin like this:

[source,bash]
----
npm i @liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin
----

Now open the `plugins.ts` file, import the Dashboard plugin, and register it with the application as shown below:

.src/app/plugins.ts
[source,typescript]
----
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-empty-function */
import { Application } from 'lisk-sdk';
import { DashboardPlugin } from '@liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin';
//[...]

export const registerPlugins = (app: Application): void => {
   	//[...]
    app.registerPlugin(new DashboardPlugin());
};
----

Save and close the `plugins.ts` file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is essential to enable WS API and configure the `allowedMethods` property before registering the `DashboardPlugin`.
For more information, see the configurations described in the xref:{url_guides_config_hello}[configuration guide].
====

After updating the *custom_config.json* file, build the blockchain client again:

[source,bash]
----
npm run build
----

== Starting the node

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to enable the Dashboard plugin without updating the `plugins.ts` file as suggested in the aforementioned steps.
Once the plugin is installed, you can add the `--enable-dashboard-plugin` flag to the `start` command to run the node.

[tabs]
=====
Sidechain::
+
--
* Start the blockchain client with designated flags on a `sidechain` node.
+
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start --config=config/custom_config.json --enable-dashboard-plugin
----
--
Mainchain::
+
--
* *Or*, start the blockchain client with designated flags on a `mainchain` node.
For more information, see xref:{url_network_page}[Networks], xref:{url_mainchain_page}[Mainchain] and the xref:{url_coreIndex_page}[Lisk Core] docs.
+
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core start --network testnet --enable-dashboard-plugin
----
--
=====
====

If you registered the Dashboard via `plugins.ts`, then perform the following:

.Start the blockchain client with 'custom_config.json' without any flag
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start --config=config/custom_config.json 
----

Wait until the application start has been completed.
Now it is possible to access the Dashboard on the browser under `localhost: 4005`

You can also see the blockchain client logs to confirm the registration of the Dashboard plugin.

== Dashboard walkabout

Go to http://localhost:4005[^] to access the Dashboard.

=== Invoke command

The Dashboard plugin allows you to invoke various commands via the *Invoke command* section.

The *Invoke command* section lists all the module-based commands registered to a node. 

The command type is selected from the dropdown box.

As we registered the `DashboardPlugin` with the `hello_client`, it is possible to send a hello message via the Dashboard.

.Select the 'hello_createHello' command.
image::guides/dashboard/send_tx_dropdown.png["Transaction dropdown",750,align="center"]

Once the desired command type is selected, provide the `passphrase` of the sender account and the hello `message`.

The passphrase is present in the `passphrase.json` file, which is located in the `config/default` directory of the blockchain client.

You can use the {url_gitHub_passphrase}[passphrase^] of the `genesis` account of `hello_client`.

The hello message can be:

[source,json]
----
{
	"message": "Greetings from Lisk!"
}
----

Once all the necessary parameters are input, click on the kbd:[Submit] button.

.Enter information about the hello message
image::guides/dashboard/send_tx_hello.png["Send transaction",750,align="center"]

If the transaction was successfully accepted, you will see the following confirmation:

.Send 'createHello' transaction to node
image::guides/dashboard/send_tx_success.png["Transaction Sent successfully",1000,align="center"]

Once the transaction is confirmed and added to the chain, it can be seen in the *Recent Transaction* section.

.Recent transactions
image::guides/dashboard/recent_transactions.png["Recent transactions",750,align="center"]

=== Call endpoints

It is possible to invoke endpoints of registered Modules and Plugins via the Dashboard.
Endpoints can be invoked from the *Call endpoint* section. 

In the previous guides, the following endpoints were created:

.*For Module:*
. The endpoint `hello_getHello` is for xref:{url_guides_module_getHello}[Getting the latest Hello for an address].

.*For Plugin:*
. The endpoint `helloInfo_getMessageList` is for xref:{url_guides_plugin_getMessageList}[Getting a list of all Hello messages sent on-chain].

To invoke an endpoint through the Dashboard, refer to the following section:

==== Invoking `hello_getHello`

To verify that the hello message was sent successfully, select the `hello_getHello` endpoint from the section *Call endpoint*.

The `hello_getHello` endpoint is part of the xref:{url_guides_module_endpoints}[HelloModule endpoints] and it returns the last sent hello message for the account address that is specified in the endpoint input.

Provide the `address` to which the passphrase belongs.
For `hello_client` the passphrase points to the first account in the {url_dev_validator}[dev-validators.json^] file, which is located in the `config/default` directory of the hello client.

.Enter an address to fetch the latest hello message
image::guides/dashboard/call_action.png["Invoke hello_getHello",750,align="center"]

In response, the Dashboard will display the latest hello message sent from the specified account.

.Latest hello message from the given account
image::guides/dashboard/call_action_success.png["Get latest hello message for the given account",1000,align="center"]


==== Invoking `helloInfo_getMessageList`

Select `helloInfo_getMessageList` from the dropdown menu.

.Select the 'helloInfo_getMessageList' endpoint
image::guides/dashboard/call_pluginaction.png["Invoke plugin action",750]

You can directly click on the kbd:[Submit] button to view the results.
The endpoint doesn't require any input for the request to proceed.

.List of all the hello messages sent on-chain
image::guides/dashboard/call_pluginaction_success.png["Plugin action success",1000]

As expected, the Dashboard responds with a list of hello messages that were posted to the Lisk application.

=== Subscribing to events

At the bottom of the Dashboard is the *Recent events* window, which allows the possibility to subscribe to various events by selecting them from a dropdown box.

Select the `hello_newHello` event.

.Subscribe to the 'newHello' event
image::guides/dashboard/subscribe_event.jpg["Subscribe to newHello event", 1000,align="center"]

Once a new hello transaction is posted, the `newHello` event is also published, and will subsequently appear in the *Recent events* window.

image::guides/dashboard/receive_newHello_event.png[]

[TIP]
==== 
The value of the `senderAddress` retrieved in the `hello_newHello` event is in the `hex` format, which can be easily converted to the Lisk32 format through the `cryptography` package.
For example:

.Converting a binary address into lisk32 format via 'lisk console'
[source,bash]
----
lisk.cryptography.address.getLisk32AddressFromAddress(Buffer.from("8ebe46d631ae4cc7ad14ba5235edde56c5f34ec6", 'hex'));
----
For more information, see {url_typedoc_crypto}[getLisk32AddressFromAddress^].
====

The Dashboard plugin provides various other features as well, most of which are very self-explanatory.
For example, you can create new accounts, see unconfirmed transactions, and see recently generated blocks.
It is also possible to view the general node and network information, etc., through the Dashboard plugin.
