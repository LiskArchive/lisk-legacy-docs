In the "Understand Lisk blockchain" category you learn the basic concepts of Lisk blockchain, Lisk Network, and Lisk xref:{url_sidechain_glossary}[Sidechain application (sApp)]. The page discusses the topics and terms that are important to know when developing within the Lisk ecosystem.

== What is the Lisk Blockchain?

A blockchain footnote:blockchain_footnote[For a general introduction into blockchain, please check out the introduction page xref:{url_what_is_blockchain}[What is blockchain].] is a chain of interconnected blocks on various nodes distributed across a P2P network.
Each node runs using an instance of the blockchain client and also stores node-specific on-chain and off-chain data.
It syncs periodically with other nodes to ensure that the nodes' records are up to date.

The Lisk blockchain also follows the same principle.
The Lisk blockchain can actually be described as an **ecosystem of blockchains**, where many different blockchains are interconnected through a central blockchain, called the **Lisk Mainchain**.
All other connected blockchains are called *sidechains* in this context.
To become interoperable with any other blockchain in the Lisk ecosystem, a blockchain needs to follow the xref:{url_understand_interoperability}[] protocol.

Each sidechain is registered to the mainchain and is specific to a sidechain application.
Every blockchain is maintained by a network of blockchain nodes.
These applications can have customized logic, UIs, and a sidechain as their application's database.
For more information about Lisk Protocol, see {url_protocol}[Lisk Improvement Proposals].

== What are sidechain applications?

A sidechain application refers to a software that contains a lisk based sidechain client, a middleware and a UI.

.Examples of sidechain applications
****
Examples of sidechain applications can be found in the tutorials, such as the xref:{url_tutorials_nft}[], or the xref:{url_tutorials_srs}[] application.

Additionally, check out the apps list on the {url_lisk_apps}[Sidechain applications powered by Lisk^] page.
****

Unlike smart contract based platforms, where smart contracts have to share the same chain for their blockchain needs, Lisk provides the opportunity for each application to have its own blockchain.

This enables slower chain growth as information is only received from a single sApp.
It also provides faster block generation, reduces the burden on the network, and increases scalability as discussed on the xref:{url_scalability_introduction}[Blockchain Scalability] page.
These sidechains can also communicate with other sidechains with the help of xref:{lisk_cross_chain_communication}[Lisk Cross Chain Communication].

An overview of Lisk Blockchain can be seen below in the following diagram.

.Overview of Lisk Blockchain
image::understand-blockchain/lisk-blockchain-overview.png["Lisk blockchain overview", 600, align="center"]

sApps are highly customizable as Lisk allows, creating a scalable UI and business logic on top of the xref:{url_lisk_service}[Lisk Service]. 

Lisk Service is an enriched node API that provides a convenient method of sending or getting data from the Lisk blockchain. 
It supports all the Lisk APIs that post data to the blockchain. 
It also allows data aggregation of the relevant data for external services, enriching it if needed with off-chain data as well. 
Lisk Service also provides additional endpoints to get the data efficiently.

=== The three domains of a sidechain application

From a high-level perspective, there are three domains of a sApp as described below:

.The three domains of a sidechain application
image::understand-blockchain/3-domains.png["3-domains of blockchain", 500,align="center"]

. **Application domain**: Responsible for verifying data and transitioning the blockchain's state with deterministic logic via the xref:{url_understand_state_machine}[state machine].
. xref:{url_understand_consensus}[*Consensus domain*]: Responsible for replicating the same sequence of states among all nodes in the network.
Nodes achieve this in the network by following a xref:{url_intro_consensus}[consensus protocol] and utilizing the application and network domains.
. xref:{url_understand_network}[*Network domain*]: Responsible for the communication of the peer-to-peer network.

The three domains are the pillars of the Lisk blockchain and are the only core part of the Lisk Protocol.  
Their functionality is defined by Lisk and can only be configured if needed. 
The state machine, which is part of the application domain contains code written by the developer for a sApp.

Other components of the application that are not part of the three sidechain domains, such as the Transaction Pool, etc. can be implemented differently by the developer if desired, without breaking the protocol.

TIP: It is recommended to use Lisk's implementation of the <<engine-layer, engine>> components to avoid erroneous behavior.

=== Network topology
The Lisk ecosystem consists of various interconnected sApps.
Each sApp maintains a separate, independent sidechain with a network of interconnected servers, which are also called *nodes* in this context. 

The different sApps communicate with each other via relayer nodes by following the xref:{url_understand_interoperability}[] protocol.

A typical network of chains and their nodes is illustrated in the diagram below:

.Lisk network for chains and their nodes
image::intro/node-network.png[Side chain's node network, 800 ,align="center"]

.Shared on-chain logic, optional off-chain logic
****
All nodes belonging to the same sidechain application need to share the same on-chain logic as described in <<Modules>>.
On the contrary, the off-chain logic as discussed in <<Plugins>> can differ from node to node.
****

// ==== Communication between chains
// Lisk supports cross-chain communication and allows sidechains to communicate with each other via *relayers*.
// A relayer is a blockchain node that collects cross-chain messages and relays them across chains.
// It does so by invoking the RPC endpoints available for cross-chain communication. 

=== The Architecture of sidechain applications

As mentioned earlier, a sApp consists of a network of nodes connected via P2P.
*Each node has an instance of the Lisk sidechain client and together, these nodes form a chain*. The on-chain logic present in each instance of the Lisk sidechain application must be the same for a chain. However, the off-chain logic for each node can differ within a chain.

Each sApp has its own separate blockchain which is known as a sidechain. This sidechain is registered with the mainchain.


The architecture of a sApp is divided into the following two layers:

* Application layer
* Engine layer

A detailed illustration of the sApp's architecture can be seen in the following diagram below.

.A detailed illustration of the Lisk Sidechain Application
image::architecture.png[lisk-framework-architecture, 700 , align="center"]

==== Application layer
The application layer handles state changes to the sidechain.
The function of the application layer is to act as an interface to connect to the outside world, such as various external services in order to send and receive data.
An application layer consists of a <<State machine>>, <<Modules>>, <<Plugins>>, and <<Configuration>>.

===== State machine

As the name suggests, a xref:{url_understand_state_machine}[state machine] is relevant to the states of a machine. A sApp relies heavily on its state machine to mutate the state of a sidechain. 

* *States:* A state machine is deterministic and can have multiple states, but only one state at any given time. For example, a basic analogy could be whereby a padlock represented as a state machine would have the following two states "Unlocked" and "Locked".

* *Transitions*: A transition is defined as the instantaneous transfer from one state to another state. For example, using our padlock analogy, to change from the state "Unlocked" to "Locked", a transition would be "Close padlock", and then from "Locked" to "Unlocked", it would be "Insert key & turn".

The application layer changes states by using modules, which define the on-chain logic for the sidechain application.

===== Modules

xref:{url_introduction_modules}[Modules] aid the state machine to transition the state of the sidechain with verified and validated data.
They contain on-chain logic which is part of the sidechain protocol.

For example, if Bob wants to send 10 LSK tokens to Alice then, behind the scenes a module will verify the validity of such a request.
Upon validation and verification, the module will ask the state machine to transfer 10 LSK tokens from Bob's account to Alice's account.

// TIP: Lisk provides a range of default modules out of the box. These modules are created automatically whenever a sidechain application is bootstrapped via Lisk Commander. For more information, see the xref:{url_lisk_default_modules}[].
TIP: Lisk provides a range of default modules out of the box. These modules are created automatically whenever a sidechain application is bootstrapped via Lisk Commander. For more information, see the modules reference page.

====== When to create a module

Modules are able to perform the following functions:

* Define how data is stored on the sidechain.
* Define logic that is executed per block footnote:block_footnote[For more information about blocks, check out xref:{url_protocol_blocks}[Blocks].]
* Define logic that is executed per transaction footnote:tx_footnote[For more information about transactions, see xref:{url_protocol_transactions}[Transactions].].

===== Plugins

xref:{url_introduction_plugins}[] represent the off-chain logic.
A plugin is not part of the application layer and must be registered with the sApp before its use.
Each node inside the network can deploy various kinds of plugins to support their off-chain logic.

For example, consider a case whereby a node wants to investigate any possible misbehavior in the Lisk network. To achieve this, the node operator must acquire all the blocks' data from the network, save it, and then analyze it to determine if any misbehavior had occurred.

// A node manager can write a script to perform the aforementioned task. However, Lisk provides the xref:{url_references_report_misbbehavior_plugin}[Report Misbehavior Plugin] which listens to blocks' data and reports a node with regard to a generator's misbehavior.
A node manager can write a script to perform the aforementioned task. However, Lisk provides the Report Misbehavior Plugin which listens to blocks' data and reports a node with regard to a generator's misbehavior.

To add a new plugin to your application, either reuse an existing plugin from another sApp or create a new plugin based on the specific requirements of your application.

// TIP: Lisk provides a set of plugins that can be injected into the Application layer when needed. For more information, see xref:{url_sdk_plugins}[Plugins].
TIP: Lisk provides a set of plugins that can be injected into the Application layer when needed. For more information, see Plugins.

====== When to create a plugin

Plugins are able to perform the following:

* Search the blockchain data.
* Aggregate the blockchain data.
* Automate the blockchain logic, such as automatically sending transactions.

===== Configuration
The Lisk solution is both convenient and flexible in terms of how to operate a node, coupled with how to execute both on-chain and off-chain logic. 
To serve this purpose, the sApp accepts a configuration that is part of the state machine.

A set of default configurations are passed to a sApp.
These configurations can be individually tweaked as necessary.
For off-chain components and logic, e.g. Plugins, etc., the configurations can differ for each node.
However, the Genesis configuration and the configuration for Modules must be the same across the network of a sApp.

TIP: For more information about the available configurations, see xref:{url_advanced_architecture_config}[].

==== Engine layer
The Engine layer acts as a bridge between the *Sidechain* and the *Application layer*. The engine is responsible for managing upcoming transactions, generating blocks, reaching consensus, storing the chain\'s data in data stores, and dispersing the new blocks to other nodes on the network.

An engine layer consists of the following components:

* Transaction Pool
* Generator
* Consensus
* P2P

===== Transaction Pool
A transaction pool is where new transactions exist before they become part of the blockchain.
It can be considered similar to mempool in Ethereum.
Whenever a new transaction is created, it has to be sent to a transaction pool.
The transaction pool receives the new transaction, verifies it and then stores it temporarily in the transaction pool until it becomes part of a block.

A node operator can configure the Transaction pool via the *Configurations* passed to the Application layer.

Once a set of verified transactions are available in the pool, they are sent to the generator for further processing.

===== Generator
A generator handles the generation of new blocks.
The generator picks up the transactions from the transaction pool and orders them and 
then executes each transaction with the help of the state machine to check its validity.
Once verified, the transactions are added to the block header.
//For more information about Generator and Block Generation, see <<URL>>

===== Consensus
The consensus component applies the xref:{url_fork_choice_rule}[fork choice rule] and checks the properties contained in the block header.
It is also responsible for the replication of the same sequence of states among all nodes in the network.
After a block reaches consensus and the state has been changed, the new block's information is then passed to the blockchain.
For more information, see xref:{url_understand_consensus}[Consensus].

// ===== Chain
// After a block reaches consensus and the state has been changed, the new block's information is then passed to the Chain.
// The chain stores the transaction data in a data store.

// A chain is also responsible for fetching blockchain data from the data stores.

===== P2P
The P2P component handles sending and receiving data from nodes. 
It also maintains an active connection with the Lisk network. 
Every node receives new blocks generated by other nodes via the P2P network.
The receiver node in that case repeats all the steps mentioned in the <<Engine layer>>. 
If the received block is verified, then the receiving node adds it to its blockchain instance.

===== Data Stores
Each blockchain node is an instance of a particular sidechain and keeps the data on various data stores inside.
This data contains the following two types: on-chain and off-chain.

* *On-chain* data includes but is not limited to state data of the chain, account balance, nonce, multi-signature keys, generators' information, and the Sparse Merkel tree, etc.
The blocks, transactions, events, and assets are also part of the on-chain data among various other properties.

* *Off-chain* data includes but is not limited to node information, peer list, random hash, etc. 
It also contains information for generators i.e. last generated block, encrypted keys, etc.
Lisk also maintains off-chain data regarding the legacy chains.
Legacy data consists of blocks from depreciated versions of the protocol.

==== Communication interfaces / APIs

.RPC Communication of a Lisk node
image::intro/communication-architecture.png[communication-interfaces,1000 ,align="center"]

The communication architecture of a sApp allows internal application components and external services to communicate to the sApp via various channels.

The Lisk blockchain provides three industry-standard communication protocols: Inter-Process Communication (IPC), Web Sockets (WS), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
The communication protocol of a sApp can be changed through xref:{url_advanced_architecture_config}[configurations].

It is possible to communicate to modules and plugins directly by invoking xref:{url_advanced_communication_endpoints}[endpoints] via an RPC request, or by subscribing to xref:{url_advanced_communication_events}[events].

It is recommended to use the IPC/WebSocket protocols where possible, as they provide more enhanced performance regarding the response times, (see the blog post: {url_blog_benchmark}[Benchmarking Lisk Core v3.0.0 against Lisk Core v2.1.6]).

For more information about the communication architecture, see xref:{url_advanced_communication}[Communicating to a Lisk node via RPC].



=== Frontend & UI integration
.Different sidechain application structures
image::intro/ui-diagrams.png[different-structures-of-blockchain-application,700 ,align="center"]

sApps usually consist of a frontend and a backend (sidechain client), just like normal web applications.

In contrast to normal server-client applications, there is not one central backend, but rather a whole network of nodes running instances of a similar sidechain client, that together secure and maintain the status of the blockchain.
Each node can handle complex business logic and provides a flexible and customizable API.
The blockchain itself is used as a database layer for the application.

The frontend allows users to interact with the sidechain client.
The implementation of a frontend is flexible.
For example, this can be achieved in the following ways:

[loweralpha]
. Use your favorite framework/ programming language to develop a *standalone user interface*, and communicate to the node via the available <<communication-interfaces-apis>>. 
Please be aware, every node has only a few basic API endpoints as described in the xref:{url_rpc_endpoints}[RPC API for the Lisk nodes] page, which might not be ideally suited for more complex UIs. 
In this case, we recommend using the enriched API of Lisk Service as middleware to communicate between the frontend and sidechain client.  

.. One example is the frontend of the {url_github_srs}[SRS example application^], which has been developed with React.js. 
Another example is the UI for the Hello application, detailed in the guide xref:{url_integrate_ui}[].  

. **[recommended]** For later requirements in a production environment, we highly recommend using xref:{url_lisk_service_intro}[Lisk Service], which will aggregate the data from the blockchain network and other 3rd party sources and will provide an enriched API with a lot more endpoints and query options for the UI.
With Lisk Service, you can also create a custom service as per your business requirements to support various UI projects, such as mobile and web applications. 
The frontend can then request this data via API requests from Lisk Service.




// TODO: this will be revised after terminology discussion.
=== Sidechain applications vs. dApps
As sidechain applications are also in a sense decentralized and distributed applications, you may wonder what is the difference between sApps and dApps, or if there is any difference at all.

In short, the main difference between dApps and sApps is that each sApp runs on its own blockchain known as a sidechain. However, dApps share the blockchain network with other dApps.

dApps are generally constructed as smart contracts, for example on the Ethereum blockchain.
The development of sApps is quite different because it is much similar to building a normal web application.

Most functionalities of smart contracts can be implemented in sApps in a very straightforward manner. 
However, there is one important difference here to dApps, when it comes to applying new on-chain logic to the application.
New smart contracts can be directly applied on the running blockchain while adding new on-chain logic to sApps always requires a hard fork in the network. 

If the flexible characteristics of smart contracts are desired inside a blockchain application, it is of course also possible to develop a sApp that supports smart contracts.
For example, a new module could be added to the application, which accepts smart contracts.
This way it is possible to have the best of both worlds combined.

Additionally, smart contracts can reuse an already existing blockchain, which saves time when launching the application, as it is not necessary to take care of setting up an independent blockchain network, and finding generators footnote:delegate_footnote[For more information about generators, check the xref:{url_protocol_consensus}[Consensus protocol] of Lisk.], etc.

sApps on the contrary rely on their own sidechains, and therefore also need to take care of maintaining their network for each sidechain.
In the beginning, this will make the launch of the application slightly more complex, however, having an independent network comes with numerous benefits which are covered in the following paragraphs.

The Lisk documentation refers to applications built with the Lisk protocol as "sidechain applications" and not "dApps". To clarify the difference, sApps do not share a common blockchain, but instead, each runs on its own chain.
As a result sApps have the following advantages:

* Lower transaction fees, as the high traffic of one sApp, does not affect other sApps.

* The sidechain for the sApp can be designed with the optimal characteristics for the specific use case, (for example by adjusting the block time or the number of generators or even changing the whole consensus algorithm).

* A much more scalable blockchain, as it only handles the data from one sApp.
Hence it grows much slower in size and doesn't suffer as much from potential bottlenecks in the network, which can happen during times of high workload on many different dApps.

* Interoperability is a key benefit of Lisk. Various sidechains registered to the mainchain can efficiently and securely communicate with each other and exchange data through the mainchain. 
A detailed account of Lisk interoperability features is discussed on the xref:{lisk_cross_chain_communication}[Lisk Cross Chain Communication] page.
