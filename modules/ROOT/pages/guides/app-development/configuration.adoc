[[intro]]
The `Application` instance which is exported by the Lisk SDK, is configured to run with the <<config_options, default config options>> that are defined in the Lisk Framework.

To change the configuration, pass a config object as parameter when creating a new `Application` instance.

During development of a blockchain application it is recommended to import and use the {url_github_config_devnet}[configDevnet^] object from the Lisk SDK.
Together with `genesisBlockDevnet`, which defines the <<genesis_block, genesis block>>, it sets up a local development environment with 101 forging genesis delegates.

.index.js of the Hello World app
[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); <1>
const HelloTransaction = require('./hello_transaction');

configDevnet.label = 'hello-world-app'; <2>
//configDevnet.components.storage.user = 'lisk';
//configDevnet.components.storage.password = 'password';
//configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.whiteList = ["127.0.0.1","1.2.3.4"];
//configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.public = true;

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); <3>
app.registerTransaction(HelloTransaction);

app
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(0);
    });
----

<1> Imports the `configDevnet` object.
<2> Optionally it is possible to override certain options in `configDevnet` before creating the application instance.
<3> Creates the application instance and passes the `genesisBlockDevnet` as genesis block and `configDevnet` as config.

[[config_options]]
== Configuration options

=== List of all available config options

To get a complete overview of all configuration options for the Lisk SDK, please refer to the xref:{url_reference_config}[configuration reference].

=== Constants

Specific constants for the blockchain application are set inside `configDevnet.genesisConfig`
These constants allow the basic properties of the blockchain to be easily adjusted. For example, the time that elapses until a new block is forged, the network epoch time, and the block rewards.

In the alpha version of the Lisk SDK, at present not all of the available constants are configurable by the user yet.
However, in future versions more constants will become configurable.

TIP: To see a full list of all constants and their predefined values, please see the file {url_github_constants_schema}[application_config_schema.js^].

=== Default configuration options

The **default** configuration options are located in the {url_github_sdk}[Lisk SDK repository^] in GitHub:

* `framework/src/modules/<module-name>/defaults/config.js` for each module.
* `framework/src/components/<component-name>/defaults/config.js` for each component.

TIP: Go to the xref:{url_reference_config}[configuration reference], to get a summary of all available config options and their default values.

Each `config.js` file consists of 2 parts:

. JSON-schema specification for all available config options.
. Default values for the available config options for this specific module.

[CAUTION]
====
Please do not change the default values in these files directly as they will be overwritten when software updates are performed.
Instead of changing the default values, define the custom configuration options inside your blockchain application.
====

[[genesis_block]]
== The genesis block

The xref:{url_protocol_genesis_block}[genesis block] describes the very first block in the blockchain.
It defines the initial state of the blockchain on start of the network.

The genesis block is not forged by a delegate, such as all of the other blocks which come after the genesis block.
Instead it is defined by the developer, when <<intro,creating the Application>> instance of the blockchain application.

=== The devnet genesis block

The Lisk SDK exposes an object `genesisBlockDevnet` that holds all of the required important information to spin up a local development network.

TIP: Go to Github, to see the full file {url_github_genesis_block}[genesis_block_devnet.json^]

[NOTE]
====
A genesis block generator to create genesis blocks will be included in the Lisk SDK eventually.
For Lisk Alpha SDK, the exposed `genesisBlockDevnet` can be used as a template, and customized to your requirements.
====

The following template shown below describes all properties of a genesis block:
