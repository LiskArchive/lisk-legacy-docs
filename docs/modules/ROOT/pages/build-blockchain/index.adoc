The "Build Blockchain" category contains all the guides related to the development of a blockchain client with the Lisk SDK.

== The "Hello World" client

By the example of the "Hello World" client, it is explained how to build a very simple blockchain client step by step in the following chapters.

NOTE: Although the example is kept very simple by intention, the Hello World client implements all the most important components, and is therefore a good example to understand the basics of the development of a blockchain client.

The "Hello World" client allows each account to save a greeting message on-chain.
It also stores the addresses of senders of the greeting message, in an off-chain database.
The following guides each focus on developing a specific part of the Hello client.

. xref:{url_guide_app}[]: How to bootstrap a default blockchain client.
. xref:{url_guide_config}[]: How to create a custom configuration for a blockchain client.
. xref:{url_guide_module}[]: How to create a new module and how to add it to the client.
In the example, the `HelloModule` will contain all on-chain logic related to the Hello message.
.. xref:{url_guide_command}[]: How to create a new command and how to add it to a module.
In the example, the "Create Hello" command saves Hello messages of accounts, if they send a corresponding transaction.
. xref:{url_guide_plugin}[]: How to create a new plugin and how to add it to the blockchain client.
.. In the example, the `HelloInfoPlugin` will save all sent Hello messages, their corresponding sender address, and the corresponding block height of each event in an off-chain database.
.. It will also expose an endpoint to retrieve the data from the off-chain database.
.. The plugin will also be configured and based on the configuration, the plugin will sync with the sidechain after regular intervals.
. xref:{url_guide_genesisblock}[]: How to generate a new genesis block for a blockchain.
