- How to create a sendable transaction object of the new type, and broadcast it to the network.

## Hello World
__Tutorial on how to create a new transaction type from scratch__

We introduce you our hello world application built using the alpha SDK. This tutorial explains how to create a new transaction type from scratch.

It is a simple example to showcase how to create a new transaction type by implementing the [`BaseTransaction` interface](custom-transactions.md).

The Cashback application is an example of a simple but valid use case - a cashback transaction.
