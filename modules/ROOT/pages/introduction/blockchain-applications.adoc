== What are blockchain applications?

A blockchain application is any kind of application which uses its' own blockchain as database layer.

More specifically, in the Lisk documentation, everytime we talk about blockchain applications, we refer to applications which are runnning on blockchains which are compatible with xref:{url_protocol}[].

.Examples of blockchain applications
****
Examples of blockchain applications can be found in the tutorials, like the xref:{url_tutorials_hello}[], the xref:{url_tutorials_nft}[] or the xref:{url_tutorials_srs}[] application.

Additionally, check out the apps list at {url_lisk_apps}

== Blockchain applications vs. dApps

As blockchain applications are also in a sense decentralized applications, you may wonder what is the difference between blockchain applications and dApps, or if there is any difference at all.

In short, the main difference between dApps and blockchain applications is, that blockchain applications each run on their own blockchain/sidechain, while dApps are sharing the blockchain network with other dApps.

dApps are generally constructed as smart contracts, for example on the Ethereum blockchain.
The development of blockchain applications is quite different, because it is much more similar to building a normal web application.

Most functionalities of smart contracts can be implemented in blockchain applications much easier and straight forward.
But here is one important difference to dApps, when it comes to applying new <<on-chain-logic>> to the application:
New smart contracts can be directly applied on the running blockchain, while adding new on-chain logic to blockchain applications requires always a hard fork in the network.
Therefore, blockchain applications are less flexible than dApps, when it comes to uploading new logic on the running chain.

Additionally, smart contracts can reuse an already existing blockchain, which saves time when launching the application, because it is not needed to take care of setting up an independent blockchain network, finding delegates, etc.
Blockchain applications on the contrary rely on their own blockchain, and therefore also need to take care of maintaining their own network.
In the beginning, this will make the launch of the application a little more complex, but having an independent network comes along with a lot of benefits, which are listed in the next paragraphs.
If the flexible characteristics of smart contracts are desired inside a blockchain application, it is of course also possible to develop a blockchain application which supports smart contracts.
For example, a new module could be added to the application, which accepts smart contracts.
This way it is possible to have the best of both worlds combined.

The Lisk documentation is referring to applications built with the Lisk SDK as blockchain applications and not dApps to clarify the difference, that applications are not sharing a common blockchain, but instead are each running on their own chain.
As an effect, blockchain applications have the following advantages:

* Lower transaction fees, as high traffic of one blockchain application has no effect on other blockchain applications.
* The blockchain for the application can be designed with the optimal characteristics for the specific use case (for example by adjusting the block time or the number of delegates, or even changing the whole consensus algorithm).
* High security: A blockchain application is never affected by security issues and hacks of other blockchain applications.
* A much more scalable blockchain, as it only handles the data from one blockchain application.
Therefore it is growing much slower in size, and doesn't suffer so much from possible bottlenecks in the network, which can happen during times of high workload on a lot of different dApps.
* Interoperability: Register a blockchain application as sidechain to connect it to the Lisk Mainchain (coming {url_lisk_roadmap}[soon^]).
This will provide seamless interoperability to the Lisk Mainchain and all of its' connected sidechains.

== Architecture of blockchain applications

=== Frontend & backend

Blockchain application usually have a frontend and a backend part, like normal web applications.

The backend of a blockchain application is basically the whole blockchain application, and is in blockchain context often referred as *node*.
In contrast to normal server-client applications, there is not one central backend, but rather a whole network of nodes which together secure and maintain the status of the blockchain.

The frontend allows users to interact conveniently with the blockchain application.
The implementation of a frontend is totally flexible.
It can be achieved for example in the following ways:

[loweralpha]
. Use your favorite framework/ language to build the UI and communicate to the node via the <<communication-interfaces>>.
. Create a new plugin for the blockchain application

=== Architecture diagram

The most important components of a blockchain application are displayed in the diagram below:

image:architecture.png[lisk-framework-architecture]

=== On-chain logic

The on-chain architecture is a layer of abstraction that provides a collection of features to configure and run any business logic on the blockchain.

In short, the on-chain logic:

* introduces state mutations through blocks or transactions.
* is part of the blockchain protocol.
* is verifiable by anyone by synchronizing with the blockchain.
* is located in modules.

.When to create a new module
****
xref:{url_explanations_on_chain}[] are able to...

* define how data is stored on the blockchain
* define logic which is executed per block
* define logic which is executed per transaction

* ...transactions, check the xref:{url_protocol_transactions}[] page of the Lisk protocol.
* ...blocks, check out the xref:{url_protocol_blocks}[] page of the Lisk protocol.

The following modules are already inlcuded in the xref:{url_explanations_architecture_application}[default application], they provide a basic blockchain application with a DPoS blockchain which allows basic token transfers beetween users:

xref:{url_dpos_module}[], xref:{url_token_module}[], xref:{url_keys_module}[], xref:{url_sequence_module}[]

To extend and customize the application, register additional modules to the application.

To add a new module to your application, either reuse an already existing module from another blockchain application, or create a new module based on the specific needs of your application.

=== Off-chain logic
In short, the off-chain logic:

* introduces new blockchain application features.
* is not part of the blockchain protocol.
* is optional to execute on a full node.
* is located in plugins.

.When to create a new plugin
****
xref:{url_explanations_off_chain}[] are able to...

* search the blockchain data.
* aggregate the blockchain data.
* provide a UI for the blockchain application.
* automate the blockchain logic, such as automatically seeding transactions.
* add a proxy to the application interfaces.
****

The default application does not include any plugins by default, but the SDK is bundled with a few common plugins which can be directly imported from the Lisk SDK:

xref:{url_references_http_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_forger_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_monitor_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_report_misbbehavior_plugin}[]

To extend and customize the application, register the desired plugins to the application.

To add a new plugin to your application, either reuse an already existing plugin from another blockchain application, or create a new plugin based on the specific needs of your application.

=== Communication interfaces

image::communication-architecture.png[]

The communication architecture of the Lisk SDK allows internal application components and external services to communicate to the blockchain application via various channels.

The Lisk SDK provides two industry standard communication protocols: Inter Process Communication (IPC) and Web Sockets (WS).
The communication protocol of the blockchain application is changed in the xref:{url_explanations_architecture_config}[configuration].

It is possible to communicate to modules and plugins directly by invoking xref:{url_explanations_communication_actions}[actions] via RPC request, or by subscribing to xref:{url_explanations_communication_events}[events].

It is recommended to use the IPC/WebSocket protocols where possible, as they provide a much better performance in regards to response times (see the blog post: {url_blog_benchmark}[Benchmarking Lisk Core v3.0.0 against Lisk Core v2.1.6]).
However, if you prefer an HTTP API, you can add support for custom APIs as plugins, like the xref:{url_references_http_plugin}[].
//We also recommend to try out xref:{url_service}[Lisk Service], which provides a much more comprehensive API compared to the HTTP API plugin.

For more information about the communication architecture, check out the xref:{url_advanced_communication}[advanced explanation] of the communication architecure.
