The binary installation offers an easy and automated approach to set up Lisk Core.

[[pre_install]]
== Pre-installation

To complete the installation some prerequisites need to be fulfilled.
If you have already performed these, please proceed to the <<install, Installation>> chapter.

[[install]]
== Installation

This section details how to install Lisk Core using pre-built application packages.
Once completed, you will have a functioning node on the Lisk Network.

=== Download and execute the installation script

Download Lisk Core:

[tabs]
====
Ubuntu::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
curl -o lisk-core.tar.gz https://downloads.lisk.io/lisk/testnet/3.0.0-rc.0/lisk-core-v3.0.0-rc.0-linux-x64.tar.gz
----
--
MacOS::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
curl -o lisk-core.tar.gz https://downloads.lisk.io/lisk/testnet/3.0.0-rc.0/lisk-core-v3.0.0-rc.0-darwin-x64.tar.gz
----
--
====

Unpack it, and add it to the system path, in order to use it in the terminal:

[source,bash]
----
tar -xf ./lisk-core.tar.gz
cd lisk-core
./bin/lisk-core
----

[TIP]

====

You can make the `lisk-core` command available in the PATH, e.g. by executing

[source,bash]
----
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/lisk-core/bin"
----

See {url_set_path}[] for more information

To make `lisk-core` permanently available in the CLI, add the above snippet to `~/.bashrc`.
====

=== Verify successful installation

To verify that your Lisk node is up and running, execute the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
lisk-core start --network betanet
----

== Post-installation (optional)

=== Use pm2 to run Lisk Core in the background

It is recommended to use a process manager like {url_pm2}[PM2^] to run Lisk Core in the background.

Check the guide xref:{url_mgmt_pm2}[] for more information.

=== Log rotation

It is recommended to set up a log rotation, because the log of Lisk Core files can grow very big over time.

Check the guide xref:{url_config_logrotation}[Managing logs] in the SDK docs for more information.
