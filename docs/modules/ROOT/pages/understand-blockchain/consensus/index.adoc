A consensus protocol is the protocol for validators to **agree on one chain of blocks**.
In particular, the consensus protocol defines,

* *who* is allowed to add a new block to the blockchain,
* how validators choose the *chain* to which they add a new block and
* when a block and all included transactions are **final**, i.e., irrevocably deemed part of the blockchain.

== Consensus protocol in Lisk

In the Lisk SDK, the different aspects of the consensus protocol are handled by different sub-protocols as outlined in the table below.

|Domain|Protocol|Responsible for

|Block proposal
|xref:{url_understand_pos}[Lisk PoS] or xref:{url_understand_poa}[Lisk PoA]
|* **Choosing validators**: Deciding who can be a validator, i.e. who is allowed to add new blocks to the blockchain.
Also called "block generator selection algorithm", or "consensus algorithm".

|Agreement on one chain
|Lisk BFT
//|xref:{url_understand_bft}[Lisk BFT]
|* **Fork choice rule**: Determining how validators choose the chain to which they add a new block.
* **Block finalization**: Determining when a block (and all included transactions) is irrevocably deemed part of the blockchain.

|Certificates
|Lisk Certificates
//|xref:{url_understand_certificates}[Lisk Certificates]
|* **Certificate generation**: Certificates are generated for finalized blocks.
Certificates are crucial for submitting xref:{url_understand_ccu}[cross-chain updates] to other blockchains as they attest outgoing cross-chain messages and changes of validators.
