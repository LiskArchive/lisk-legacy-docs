=== Setup

==== Installation script fails (Binary)

===== Problem:

After running `+bash installLisk.sh install -r test+` the installation
script is aborted with the following output:

[source,shell]
----
Coldstarting Lisk for the first time
√ Postgresql is running.
X Failed to create Postgresql user.
Installation failed. Cleaning up...
Stopping Lisk components before cleanup
√ Lisk stopped successfully.
X Postgresql failed to stop.
√ Postgresql Killed.
----

===== Solution:

PostgreSQL is already installed on your system. To solve this issue
simply remove postgres by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get --purge remove postgresql postgresql-doc postgresql-common
----

==== npm install fails with error (Source)

should not be present anymore since Lisk Core `+1.2+`

===== Problem:

`+npm install+` fails with error
`+Failed at the sodium@2.0.1 preinstall script.+` When trying to install
the necessary node modules for Lisk Core, the install script fails while
trying to build sodium. This happens for newer versions of npm, which
are not supported by core 1.0.0, yet. #### Solution: Install npm version
3.10.10. Check if you have the correct Node version installed by running
`+node -v+` If the version is not ^6.14.1, first install the supported
Node version.

[source,bash]
----
nvm install 6.14.1
----

With the right node version, you can proceed to install the right
`+npm+` verison:

[source,bash]
----
node -v
v6.14.1
npm install npm@3.10.10
----

==== Nothing shown in console after starting Lisk Core (Source)

===== Problem:

After installing from Source and starting Lisk Core with
`+node app.js+`, no are logs visible in console. This is in fact an
expected behaviour, as the default console logging value in the config
is `+none+`, which means no logs are shown in the console after starting
the process. #### Solution: To verify, that your installation works as
expected, you can change the`+consoleLogLevel+` to `+error+`, `+info+`
or `+debug+`. Alternatively, you can check the log files located in
`+logs/+`, which are on `+info+` logging level by default.

=== Administration

==== Enable forging: Delegate not found

===== Problem:

When trying to activate forging on your node, it answers with
`+Delegate with publicKey: xyz not found+` #### Solution 1: Node still
syncing Check the current height of your Node and compare it with the
Height in Explorer. If your Nodes’ height is significantly lower than
the height shown in the Explorer, it means your Node is still syncing /
downloading the Lisk Blockchain. At this time, enabling forging might
fail, because the Delegate registration has not been downloaded, yet. To
solve it, just wait until your Node is fully synced. #### Solution 2:
Missing data in config Check your `+config.json+` in section
`+forging.delegates+`. If you want to enable forging for a particular
delegate on your node, you need to store an object with the delegates’
publickey and encrypted passphrase in that section as described in the
link:../user-guide/configuration/configuration.md#forging[configuration]
section.

==== Enable forging: Invalid password and public key combination

===== Problem:

When trying to activate forging on a node like described in section
link:../user-guide/configuration/configuration.md#enable-disable-forging[User
Guide/Configuration], it responds with:
`+{"message":"\"Invalid password and public key combination\""}+`. ####
Solution: As the message states, the provided combination of your
delegates publicKey and the password don’t seem to be valid. Please
ensure, both properties are set to the correct values, especially that
you don’t use the original passphrase of your account with that command.

We further explain the chosen naming in order to avoid confusion: -
*Passphrase* is always referring to your 12 word long mnemonic
passphrase that was created at the same time as your Lisk ID. You should
always keep this secure and private! For communication with the API, the
passphrase is not passed in plaintext. Instead the password is passed so
you use it to encrypt your passphrase and the encrypted passphrase is
stored in your
link:../user-guide/configuration/configuration.md[config]. - *Password*
is always referring to the secret word/s you use to encrypt your
passphrase symmetrically, like described in this
link:../user-guide/configuration/configuration.md#forging[section]
