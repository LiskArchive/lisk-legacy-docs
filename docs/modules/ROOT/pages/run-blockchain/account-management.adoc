=== Passphrases

As previously discussed, Lisk accounts employ a 12-word {url_mnemonic_passphrase}[Mnemonic Passphrase^] to ensure robust security.
It is a sequence of carefully chosen words that acts as a human-readable representation of a complex cryptographic key, as in the example displayed in the <<Creating a new passphrase>> section.
This passphrase is indispensable for accessing any Lisk wallet and conducting transactions from your account.

Using a 12-word seed phrase encompasses 128 bits of entropy, a metric that gauges the level of unpredictability or randomness in the data employed for generating the phrase.
This is due to the fact that each term within the {url_github_bip_39}[BIP 39^] mnemonic phrase embodies 11 bits of entropy, resulting in a cumulative 132 bits for a 12-word sequence.
This overall entropy amalgamates 128 bits of inherent entropy and an additional 4 bits designated for the checksum.

Nevertheless, the BIP39 seed phrase relies on a finite pool of 2,048 words, which in turn restricts the potential permutations that can be produced.
Conversely, a 24-word seed phrase comprises 256 bits of entropy, as each term encapsulates 11 bits, culminating in a total of 264 bits, including the checksum.

The same rationale holds true for the 256 bits of entropy plus an extra 8 bits for the checksum.
While a 12-word phrase offers greater memorability and ease of input, it concurrently becomes more susceptible to guessing or brute-force attacks by malicious actors.

Given the mere 128 bits of entropy, deciphering a 12-word seed phrase would necessitate significantly less time and resources compared to a 24-word counterpart with 256 bits of entropy.
Nevertheless, even in the face of heightened susceptibility to guessing, the task of brute-forcing remains nearly insurmountable.

With 12 words offering a staggering 2^128^ potential combinations, the probability of arriving at the correct combination is exceedingly remote.


== Key pair and address creation

A *private key* is derived, as defined in {url_rfc8032}[RFC 8032^], from a {url_github_bip_39}[BIP 39^] *mnemonic passphrase* and a <<key-derivation-path>>.

.Generating multiple private keys from 1 passphrase with key derivation
image::run-blockchain/key_derivation.png[addressCreation]

NOTE: Any of the child keys could be used to create a {url_wiki_Ed25519}[Ed25519^] private key. However, by default only the child key at the end of the path is used to create the Ed25519 private key.

The corresponding *public key* can then be obtained following the key generation section of {url_rfc8032}[RFC 8032^].

Finally, the *address* is generated by taking the first 20 bytes of the public key.

=== Key Derivation path

The *key derivation path* allows to derive a specific key from within a tree of keys.

The derivation path is an array of non-negative integers smaller than 2^32^.
To make it easier to read a derivation path, they are often written in a form that omits a large constant.
For example, the path `44'/134'/0'` (notice the apostrophe after each number) represents the array `[44+2^31^, 134+2^31^, 2^31^]`.

The whole derivation path is then written as `m/44'/134'/0'`, indicating that we start by deriving a master key before deriving successive child keys.

=== Creating a new passphrase

A 12 word mnemonic passphrase is required as an input to generate all corresponding account credentials for an account.

You may choose the passphrase for yourself, or generate a new random passphrase.

The node CLI can be utilized to auto-generate the passphrase quickly from the command-line.

First, start the console:

[tabs]
=====
Lisk Core::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core console
----
--
Lisk app::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run console
----
--
=====

Generate a new mnemonic passphrase using the Lisk Passphrase library:

----
 > lisk.passphrase.Mnemonic.generateMnemonic()
----

This will return a randomly generated 12 word mnemonic passphrase.

----
'anger system news one finger rifle kiss expect arena swift spirit decline'
----

=== Creating the other credentials

Next, use the xref:{url_sdk_keyscreate}[keys:create] command to generate all relevant account credentials:

IMPORTANT: The creation of new account credentials always happens off-chain.
To put the new account on-chain, it is necessary to <<account-initialization,initialize>> the new account by sending some initial tokens to the address and paying the account initialization fee.

[tabs]
=====
Lisk Core::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core keys:create
----
--
Lisk app::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run keys:create
----
--
=====

When asked for the passphrase, enter the passphrase previously created in the step <<creating-a-new-passphrase>>.

----
? Please enter passphrase:  [hidden]
? Please re-enter passphrase:  [hidden]
----

Next, you will be also asked for a password.
This password will be used to encrypt your account credentials symmetrically.

The encrypted credentials are used for example in the config, when the node needs account information to generate new blocks for a validator.

TIP: If you do not wish to encrypt your credentials, it is possible to skip this step by adding the `--no-encryption` flag to the `keys:create` command.

The password will be required everytime the credentials need to be decrypted, for example when enabling block generation on a node.
Hence, it is advisable to store and maintain the password in a secure location similar to the passphrase of the account.

----
? Please enter password:  [hidden]
? Please re-enter password:  [hidden]
----

This will then return the credentials for the account:

== Managing multiple accounts with a single passphrase

Key derivation allows multiple key pairs to be derived from the same secret passphrase as a tree of keys.

This ensures that a user can manage multiple different accounts with ease, as they are only required to remember a single passphrase.

To generate multiple accounts from the same passphrase, use the `--count` flag of the `keys:create` command, and set it to the number of accounts that you wish to create.

The key path for the new accounts will always start with the default key-derivation path and increment by +1 onwards.
If you wish to start from a different key path, you can specify an `--offset`.

[tabs]
=====
Lisk Core::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
lisk-core keys:create --passphrase your-passphrase --no-encrypt --count 2 --offset 1
----
--
Lisk app::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run keys:create --passphrase your-passphrase --no-encrypt --count 2 --offset 1
----
--
=====

The same passphrase is used for every account, the only change that will occur is the <<key-derivation-path>>, for example when signing transactions.

[NOTE]
====
If a user uses the *default key-derivation path* `m/44'/134'/0`, it is not necessary to mention it as a parameter when the account credentials are requested.

If you are using a custom key-derivation path, make sure to always specify the key derivation path when providing the passphrase.
For example, for the `transaction:create` command, the key derivation path can be specified as shown in the example snippet below:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run transaction:create hello createHello 10000000 --key-derivation-path="m/44'/134'/1'" --params='{"message":"Hello world!"}'
----
====

== Account initialization

To create a new account in the blockchain network, it is necessary to initialize the account.

A new account is initialized by sending tokens to an address for the first time.

When tokens are sent to a new address, it is required to pay an *account initialization fee*.

In the Lisk Mainnet, the account initialization fee is 0.05 LSK.

NOTE: The account initialization fee has to be paid on top of the other fees for a transaction, when tokens are sent to a new address for the first time.

Once the address has received its initial tokens, it is then saved in the user substore.

=== User Substore
The Token module features a user substore that comprises entries exclusively intended for storing user balances for a specific address and tokenID.

The user substore contains the following entries:

* key: the concatenation of an address and a token ID: address + tokenID
* value: the serialization of an object following the `userStoreSchema`.

== Lisk32 address format
The *Lisk32 representation* displays addresses as a readable string with a checksum and the "lsk" prefix.
Lisk32 addresses always have a fix length of 41 characters.

.Automatic detection of address typing errors
NOTE: A BCH checksum is used for {url_github_lip_18}[detection of small errors^] in the address.
Any errors in *up to 4 characters* are *guaranteed* to be detected and errors in *more than 5 characters* are *likely* to be detected.

.Lisk32 address example

TIP: To learn how the Lisk32 is derived from the public key, please go to {url_github_lip_18_computation}[Address Representation for User Interface Level (LIP 0018)^].

== Key Management
There are two recommended ways to manage the account keys, depending on the use case:

|===
|Key management method
|Use Case

|Using a secret passphrase
|For users that need their key pair only on local machines, e.g., for signing transactions.
It is necessary to securely store or remember a secret recovery phrase and password. However, it is not necessary to back up and store any encrypted data locally.

|Storing the encrypted secret key
|For users that solely require the key pair on a remote server, e.g., a validator node on a remote data center.
Storing and backing up an encrypted file is necessary, but the user only needs to remember or securely store one password.

== Lisk wallet passphrase and security best practices

Wallets play a crucial role, as they provide a secure means to store, send, and receive both LSK tokens and other tokens/coins.
Wallets in general come in different forms, including a variety of software wallets, such as hot wallets, custodial/non-custodial, and web wallets; hardware wallets, and even paper wallets.
They operate using a combination of public and private keys, ensuring the safety and authenticity of transactions on the Lisk blockchain.
For a more in-depth overview regarding the wallets, see {url_wallet_types}[types of wallets^].

=== Security best practices

Safeguarding this passphrase is of the utmost importance, and sharing it with others must be avoided at all costs.
If unauthorized access to this passphrase occurs, it could lead to the theft of your funds.
Regrettably, in such a scenario, the lost funds cannot be recovered.

To summarise, the optimal method for safeguarding your recovery seed involves storing it across multiple physical mediums, and placing these mediums in at least two distinct locations.
Ideally, these physical storage methods should demonstrate resilience against harsh conditions such as water, fire, and other adverse factors.
It's crucial to ensure that these duplicates of your recovery seed remain concealed to prevent unintended discovery.

In the case whereby you suspect the security of your mnemonic phrase has been compromised, possibly due to a copy being discovered or stolen, it is prudent to swiftly transfer your funds to an entirely new wallet with a different recovery seed.
Following this, take the time to assess your storage practices to prevent a recurrence of compromise.

As long as you retain your passphrase, your account access remains intact.
Furthermore, please note that your passphrase can be used interchangeably within the Lisk ecosystem.
Hence, it is possible to utilize the same passphrase to log in to both Lisk Desktop and Lisk Mobile, granting access to your account.
