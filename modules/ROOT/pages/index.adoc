The {url_github_sdk}[Lisk SDK^] is designed to provide an easy and reliable software development kit for building blockchain applications which are compatible with the xref:{url_protocol}[Lisk Protocol].

The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript and TypeScript, which is highly beneficial for the majority of developers, as no significant change of tools are required to get started.

The Lisk SDK makes every effort to ensure developers are easily able to focus purely and simply on writing the code that is required for their own blockchain application and nothing else.

---

== The Lisk SDK ecosystem

The Lisk SDK operates on the Node.js runtime and consists primarily of an application framework (xref:{url_framework}[Lisk Framework]).
This consists of a collection of libraries providing blockchain application functionalities (xref:{url_elements}[Lisk Elements]), and a powerful Command Line Interface (xref:{url_commander}[Lisk Commander]), which allows developers to manage a Lisk node instance and interact with a Lisk compatible network.

A detailed explanation regarding the underlying architecture of the Lisk Framework is described in the xref:{url_framework}[]

== SDK components

[width="100%",cols="23%,77%",options="header",]
|===
| Directory | Description
| xref:{url_framework}[Framework] | Lisk Framework is an application framework responsible for establishing and maintaining the interactions between the modules of a Lisk blockchain application.

| xref:{url_elements}[Elements] | Lisk Elements is a collection of libraries, each of them implementing some form of blockchain application functionality such as cryptography, transactions, p2p, etc.
Each library is designed to be compatible with the xref:{url_protocol}[Lisk Protocol].

| xref:{url_commander}[Commander] | Lisk Commander is a command line tool which allows the management of a Lisk node instance and interaction with a Lisk compatible network.
|===

== Usage

=== Operating Systems

The Lisk SDK will run on both the MacOS and Ubuntu operating systems. Please note that the SDK does not run on the MS Windows operating system.

=== Dependencies

The following dependencies need to be installed to run the Lisk SDK:

[options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|Node.js | v12 (latest)
|===

=== Installation

Installation of the Lisk SDK is straightforward and only requires getting a single NPM package `lisk-sdk`, to your Node.js project as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
npm install lisk-sdk
----

Lisk SDK is an all-in-one package that provides the tools to create, run and maintain blockchain applications in JavaScript.

In the case whereby only a specific functionality is required, it is possible to install only the relevant package as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
npm install lisk-commander <1>
npm install @liskhq/lisk-client <2>
----

<1> Install Lisk Commander.
<2> Install Lisk Elements client package.

TIP: View the xref:{url_elements_packages}[full list of Lisk Elements’ packages]

== Getting started

To get started with the Lisk SDK and the development of a blockchain application, please refer to the following sections in the documentation:

=== Quickstart

The quickest way to bootstrap a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK is described on the xref:{url_quickstart}[] page.

=== Tutorials

The xref:{url_tutorials}[Tutorials] explain in detail how to build a specific blockchain application.
All examples provided in the tutorials describe how to implement simple, but valid industry use cases.

The tutorials overview page provides an informative overview about all existing tutorials, including the estimated time and the skill level required to complete each specific tutorial.

TIP: All code for the example apps that is used in the tutorials is also available in the {url_github_sdk_examples}[lisk-sdk-examples repository^] on GitHub.

=== The Lisk protocol

The xref:{url_protocol}[Lisk protocol] is the set of rules followed by a blockchain created with the Lisk SDK using the default configuration.
It contains various development-agnostic specifications about the Lisk SDK.

It is a good location to look up certain topics in order to gain a deeper understanding, or to further explore the SDK in a scientific direction.

=== Architecture

The architecture pages contain various explanations about the architecture of the Lisk Framework.

It contains the following chapters:

* xref:{url_framework}[]
** xref:{url_explanations_onchain}[]
** xref:{url_explanations_offchain}[]
** xref:{url_explanations_communication}[]

=== How-To Guides

The development guides are dedicated how-to guides which cover specific topics required to build a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK.

The most relevant guides for beginners are:

* xref:{url_guides_setup}[]
* xref:{url_guides_config}[]
* xref:{url_guides_module}[]
* xref:{url_guides_asset}[]
* xref:{url_guides_frontend}[]
