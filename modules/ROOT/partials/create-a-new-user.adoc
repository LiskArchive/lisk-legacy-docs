To run and manage a Lisk Core node in the future, please create a separate `lisk` user as described below:

[TIP]
=====
The `lisk` user itself *does not need* any `sudo` rights to run the Lisk Core.
=====

[source,bash]
----
sudo adduser lisk              <1>
----

<1> Create a new user.

It is not necessarily required to set up a `lisk` user, especially when you are running a local instance for development purposes.

However, if it is required then it is recommended to https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mtusr001/mac[create the user using the MacOS GUI^].
