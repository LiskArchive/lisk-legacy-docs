The `HelloInfoPlugin` will need to store data of events emitted by the `HelloModule`. To achieve this, first, define the desired data structures as described on this page.
====
On this page, you'll learn:

* [x] Defining types for required data structures.
* [x] Defining corresponding schemas for encoding/decoding the data.
* [x] Defining constants required by the plugin.
====

TIP: The relevant files discussed in this guide are {url_github_schemas}[schemas.ts] and {url_github_types}[types.ts].

== Defining Types & Schemas
To validate and store data, we need to define interfaces and their corresponding schemas for our required data structures.

* *Defining Types:* The interfaces for the HelloInfoPlugin will be implemented in a `types.ts` file so let's create the file in the root of the `hello_info` folder.

* *Defining Schemas:* The corresponding schemas for the interfaces defined in the `types.ts` file will go in a separate file called `schemas.ts`.
Create a `schemas.ts` file in the root of the `hello_info` folder.

=== Events
The NewHelloEvent's data will be fetched from the sidechain by the HelloInfoPlugin and will be stored in the plugin's database. 

To realize this, we need to create an interface for the `Event`. 
The interface will have three properties such as a sender address, the hello message, and the xref:{url_block_height}[block height] where the event was found by HelloInfoPlugin.

Add the following in the `types.ts` file.

.hello_client/src/app/plugins/hello_info/types.ts
[source,typescript]
----
export interface Event {
    senderAddress: Buffer;
    message: string;
    height: number;
}
----

Define the corresponding `offChainEventSchema` in the `schemas.ts` file as well.

.hello_client/src/app/plugins/hello_info/schemas.ts
[source,typescript]
----
export const offChainEventSchema = {
	$id: '/helloInfo/newHello',
	type: 'object',
	required: ['senderAddress', 'message', 'height'],
	properties: {
		senderAddress: {
			dataType: 'bytes',
			fieldNumber: 1,
		},
		message: {
			dataType: 'string',
			fieldNumber: 2,
		},
		height: {
			dataType: 'uint32',
			fieldNumber: 3,
		},
	},
};
----

The `offChainEventSchema` will be used for encoding, decoding, and storing the sender address, hello message, and block height in the database.

=== Counter
The HelloInfoPlugin will store a counter for the number of NewHelloEvent stored in the off-chain database. 

Each counter's value will also be used for key generation for our off-chain database. So, let's define the `Counter` in the `types.ts` file.

.hello_client/src/app/plugins/hello_info/types.ts
[source,typescript]
----
export interface Counter {
    counter: number;
}
----

Define the corresponding `counterSchema` in the `schemas.ts` file as well.

.hello_client/src/app/plugins/hello_info/schemas.ts
[source,typescript]
----
export const counterSchema = {
	$id: '/helloInfo/counter',
	type: 'object',
	required: ['counter'],
	properties: {
		counter: {
			dataType: 'uint32',
			fieldNumber: 1,
		},
	},
};
----

=== Height
As the name suggests, we want to store the last block height checked by the plugin for NewHelloEvent retrieval.
This will enable the plugin to only check newer blocks of the sidechain for any new hello event. 

Define the `Height` interface in the `types.ts` file.

.hello_client/src/app/plugins/hello_info/types.ts
[source,typescript]
----
export interface Height {
    height: number;
}
----

For validation, encoding, and decoding purposes, add `heightSchema` in the `schemas.ts` file as well.

.hello_client/src/app/plugins/hello_info/schemas.ts
[source,typescript]
----
export const heightSchema = {
	$id: '/helloInfo/height',
	type: 'object',
	required: ['height'],
	properties: {
		height: {
			dataType: 'uint32',
			fieldNumber: 1,
		},
	},
};
----

== Defining Constants
We plan to use a key-value-based off-chain database for our plugin, which needs a set of unique "key" values. 
Part of our unique keys will come from constants that we define in a `constants.ts` file.

Create a `constants.ts` file inside the `hello_info` folder and add the following constants to it.

.hello_client/src/app/plugins/hello_info/constants.ts
[source,typescript]
----
export const DB_KEY_EVENT_INFO = Buffer.from([0]);
export const DB_LAST_COUNTER_INFO = Buffer.from([1]);
export const DB_LAST_HEIGHT_INFO = Buffer.from([2]);
----

Now that we have defined the relevant schemas, types, and constants, our plugin is ready to have the database logic, as described in the next guide.
