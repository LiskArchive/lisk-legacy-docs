=== What is the Lisk Framework

Lisk Framework is an application framework responsible for establishing
and maintaining the interactions between the modules of a Lisk
blockchain application.

Lisk Framework aims to provide a consistent and intuitive interface
between each module and component. Currently, Lisk Framework contains
`+chain+`, `+api+` and `+network+` modules.

==== Architecture Overview

The architecture of Lisk Framework follows the research documented in
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0005.md[LIP0005].
The diagram below provides a high-level overview of the architecture:

image:assets/diagram_framework.png[Logo]

==== Modules

Modules are individual building blocks for Lisk Core.

===== Core Modules

Core Modules are shipped along with the Lisk Core distribution itself.
These modules constitute the minimum requirements to run a functional
Lisk Core instance.

====== List of Core Modules

* *Chain Module:* handles all events and actions, that are related to
the blockchain system.
* *API Module:* provides HTTP API endpoints, that enable users and other
programs to interact with the Lisk blockchain through the API.
* *Network Module:* handles peer-to-peer communication of nodes in the
network.

===== Custom Modules

____
The implementation of each module is up-to user but it must inherit from
`+BaseModule+` class and implement its methods.
____

Custom Modules can be plugged into Lisk Core and may offer new
features/capabilities for the application, or replace Core modules
functionalities. They extend the existing instance with a specific (and
circumscribed) set of features.

[source,js]
----
const BaseModule = require('lisk-framework/src/modules/base_module')

// Exported as main file to javascript package
export default class MyModule extends BaseModule {
    /**
    * Constructor of the module.
    *
     * @param {Object} options - An object of module options
    */
    constructor(options) {
     super(options);
    }

    /**
    * Required.
    *
    * A unique module identifier, that can be accessed through out the system.
    * If some module already registered with the same alias, it will throw an error.
    *
    * @return {string} alias - Return the module alias as string.
    * */
    static get alias(){ return 'moduleAlias'; },

    /**
    * Required.
    *
    * Package meta information.
    *
    * @return {Object} info - JSON object referring the version, module name and module author.  
    */
    static get info(){
        return {
            author: '',
            version: '',
            name: '',
            };
    },

    /**
    * Required.
    *
    * Method which will be invoked by controller to load the module.
    * Make sure all loading logic get completed during the life cycle of load.
    * Controller emit an event `lisk:ready` which you can use to perform
    * some activities which you want to perform when every other module is loaded.
    *
    * @param {Channel} channel - An instance of a communication channel.
    * @return {Promise<void>}
    */
    async load(channel) {},


    /**
     * Supported configurations for the module with default values.
     *
     * @return {Object} defaults - JSON object with default options for the module.
     */
    get defaults() { return {}; },

    /**
     * List of valid events which this module wants to register with the controller.
     * Each event name will be prefixed by module alias, e.g. moduleName:event1.
     * Listing an event means to register the event in the application.
     * Any module can subscribe or publish that event in the application.
     *
     * @return {Array} events - String Array of events.
     */
    get events() { return []; },

    /**
     * Object of valid actions which this module want to register with the controller.
     * Each action name will be prefixed by module alias, e.g. moduleName:action1.
     * Source module can define the action while others can invoke that action.
     *
     * @return {Object} actions - Contains all available action names as key, and the corresponding function as value.
     */
    get actions() {
        return {
            action1: action => {},
        }
    },

    /**
     * Method to be invoked by controller to perform the cleanup.
     *
     * @return {Promise<void>}
     */
    async unload() {},
};
----

===== Module Communication

Modules communicate with each other through event-based
link:#channels[channels]. Modules running in different processes
communicate with each other over link:#child-process-channel[IPC
channels].

By default, modules will run in the same process as the controller,
which loads the module. To load a module in a child process, make sure
you have `+ipc+` enabled in the link:configuration.md#structure[config]
file and link:administration/source.md#command-line-options[set the
environment variable] `+LISK_CHILD_PROCESS_MODULES+` with the module
alias.

____
If the respective module is using a lot of CPU power, loading a module
in a child process can prevent CPU usage bottlenecks.
____

Multiple modules can be defined by using commas like:
`+LISK_CHILD_PROCESS_MODULES=httpApi,chain+`.

===== Module Life Cycle

The link:#controller[controller] will load/unload each module one after
another. A modules’ life cycle consists of following events in the right
order:

*Loading*

* `+channel.moduleAlias:registeredToBus+`
* `+channel.moduleAlias:loading:started+`
* `+channel.moduleAlias:loading:finished+`

==== Channels

===== InMemory Channel

Communicates with modules which reside in the same process as the
link:#controller[controller].

By default, modules will load in the same process as the controller.

===== Child Process Channel

Communicates with modules which do not reside in the same process as the
Controller.

The following methods are available for every module to use:

===== `+subscribe+`

Used to subscribe to events occurring on the controller.

[source,js]
----
channel.subscribe("moduleAlias:someEvent", eventObject => {});
----

This function accepts two arguments. The first is the event name
prefixed with the name of the relevant module. The second argument is a
callback which accepts one argument, which will be an instance of an
link:#specification_channels_event[event object].

===== `+publish+`

Used to publish events to the controller, which will be delivered to all
events subscribers.

[source,js]
----
channel.publish('myModule:myContext:myEvent', eventObject);
----

This function accepts two arguments. The first one is the event name
prefixed with the name of the relevant module. The second argument is
the data object to be passed along the event.

===== `+invoke+`

Used to invoke an action for a module.

[source,js]
----
result = await channel.invoke('moduleAlias:someEvent', actionObject);
----

This function accepts two arguments. The first one is the event name
prefixed with the name of the relevant module. The second argument is
the data object to be passed along the action.

===== Event objects

An event object is a simple JavaScript object with the following
attributes.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Property |Type |Description
|name |string |The name of the event which is triggered.

|module |string |The name of the target module for which event was
triggered.

|data |mixed |The data which was sent while publishing the event.
|===

===== Action objects

An action object is a simple javascript object with attributes listed
below.

[width="100%",cols="11%,7%,82%",options="header",]
|===
|Property |Type |Description
|name |string |Name of the action which is invoked.

|module |string |The name of the target module for which action was
invoked.

|source |string |The name of source module which invoked that action.

|params |mixed |The data which was associated with the invocation for
the action.
|===

==== Controller

The controller is responsible for initialization the communication bus
and any other dependencies required to load the modules. If any module
is configured to load as a child process, then it is the controller’s
responsibility to do so. The controller defines a set of events, that
each component can subscribe to.

The following events and actions are available for all enabled modules
and are at the same time accessible by all enabled modules.

===== Events

____
Each module can also define its own custom events or actions and will
register that list with the controller at the time of initialization.
The controller contains a complete list of events which may occur in the
modules of Lisk Core at any given time.
____

[width="100%",cols="11%,89%",options="header",]
|===
|Event |Description
|moduleAlias:registeredToBus |Triggered when the module has completed
registering its events and actions with the controller. So when this
event is triggered, the subscriber of the event can be sure that the
controller has whitelisted its requested events and actions.

|moduleAlias:loading:started |Triggered just before the controller calls
the module’s `+load+` method.

|moduleAlias:loading:error |Triggered if any error occurred during the
call of the module’s `+load+` method.

|moduleAlias:loading:finished |Triggered just after the module’s
`+load+` method has completed execution.

|moduleAlias:unloading:started |Triggered just before the controller
calls the module’s `+unload+` method.

|moduleAlias:unloading:error |Triggered if any error occurred during the
call of module’s `+unload+` method.

|moduleAlias:unloading:finished |Triggered just after the module’s
`+unload+` method has completed execution.

|lisk:ready |Triggered when the controller has finished initializing the
modules and each module has been successfully loaded.
|===

===== Actions

[width="100%",cols="21%,79%",options="header",]
|===
|Action |Description
|lisk:getComponentConfig |A controller action to get the configuration
of any component defined in controller space.
|===

==== Components

Components are shared objects within the link:#controller[controller]
layer which any link:#modules[module] can utilize. Components can use
link:#channels[channels] if required for implementation behavior. The
following components are available currently.

===== Cache

This component provides basic caching capabilities, generic enough for
any module to use if required.

===== Logger

Logger is responsible for all application-level logging activity. The
logger component can be passed to any module, where it can be extended
by adding module-specific behaviour.

===== Storage

The storage component is responsible for all database activity in the
system. It exposes an interface with specific features for getting or
setting particular database entities and a raw handler to the database
object so that any module can extend it for its own use.

Find more details about the storage component in the dedicated
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0011.md[LIP].

=== Configuration of the Lisk Framework

Configuration options are located in -
`+framework/src/modules/<module-name>/defaults/config.js+` for each
module. -
`+framework/src/components/<component-name>/defaults/config.js+` for
each component.

Each `+config.js+` file consists of 2 parts:

[arabic]
. JSON-schema specification for all available config options
. Default values for the available config options for this specific
module.

____
Please don’t change the default values in these files directly as they
will be overwritten on software updates, instead define the
link:../introduction.md[custom configuration options] inside your
blockchain application.
