# Lisk SDK Configuration

## Pass and modify default values

```js
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); // require the lisk-sdk package

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); // start the node in a fully functional devnet
const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, { // sets the required values for label, protocol and version, overrides consoleLogLevel, uses default values for everything else
    app: {
        label: 'my-label',
        minVersion: '0.0.2',
        version: '2.3.4',
        protocolVersion: '4.1'
        },
    components: {
        logger: {
            consoleLogLevel: "info"
        }
    }}); 
```
The configuration object `configDevnet` has the structure like shown in the [list of configuration options](#list-of-configuration-options).
It can be modified accordingly, before passing the config to the `Application` instance:

```js
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); // require the lisk-sdk package

configDevnet.components.storage.database = 'my-custom-db' // change the db name to my-custom-db
configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.public = true; // make the API accessible from everywhere


const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);
```

## List of configuration options

Here is a complete list of all the available configuration options of the Lisk SDK.

The values below are the __default values__. They will be used automatically when starting the application as described in [start with default values](#start-with-default-values).
To change them, override the specific default values with custom ones, when initializing the application.

```js
{
    app:{
        label: "", // label of the application (required)
        version: "", // version of the application (required)
        minVersion: "", // minimal compatible version (required)
        protocolVersion: "", // protocol Version of the application (required)

## Constants

Inside `app.genesisConfig` specific constants for the blockchain application are set.

In the alpha version of the Lisk SDK, not all available constants are configurable by the user.
Only the configurable constants are listed above.
In future versions of the Lisk SDK, more constants will become configurable.

*To see a full list of all constants and their predefined values, check out [framework/src/controller/schema/constants_schema.js](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk/blob/development/framework/src/controller/schema/constants_schema.js).*

# The Genesis block

The genesis block describes the very first block in the blockchain.
It defines the initial state of the blockchain on start of the network.

The genesis block is not forged by a delegate, like all other blocks, which come after the genesis block.
Instead, it is defined by the blockchain application developer, when creating the `Application` instance of the blockchain app (see section [pass and modify default config values](#pass-and-modify-default-values)).

> Go to Github, to see the full file [genesis_block_devnet.json](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk/blob/development/sdk/src/samples/genesis_block_devnet.json)

A genesis block generator to create genesis blocks conveniently will be included in the Lisk SDK eventually. For Lisk Alpha SDK, you can use the exposed `genesisBlockDevnet` as a template, and customize it to your needs.

It's possible and recommended to customize the genesis block to suit the use case of your blockchain application. The following template describes all available options for the genesis block.

```js
{
    "version": 0, // block version
    "totalAmount": "10000000000000000", // the total amount of tokens that are transferred in this block
    "totalFee": "0", // the total amount of fees associated with the block
    "reward": "0", // reward for forging the block
    "payloadHash": "198f2b61a8eb95fbeed58b8216780b68f697f26b849acf00c8c93bb9b24f783d", // hashes of the combined transactional data blocks
    "timestamp": 0, // epoch timestamp of when the block was created
    "numberOfTransactions": 103, // number of transactions processed in the block
    "payloadLength": 19619, // sum of data blocks of all transaction in this block in bytes
    "previousBlock": null, // null, because the genesis block has no previous block by definition
    "generatorPublicKey": "c96dec3595ff6041c3bd28b76b8cf75dce8225173d1bd00241624ee89b50f2a8", // public key of the delegate who forged the block
    "transactions": [], // list of transactions in the genesis block
    "height": 1, // current height of the blockchain, always equals 1 for the genesis block
    "blockSignature": "c81204bf67474827fd98584e7787084957f42ce8041e713843dd2bb352b73e81143f68bd74b06da8372c43f5e26406c4e7250bbd790396d85dea50d448d62606", // signature of the block, signed by the delegate
    "id": "6524861224470851795" // block id
}
```
